<h2 class="nobreak">Introduction</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE journey recorded in these pages was made in
the summer before the great war, and although
the record of my impressions and the story of my
adventures were fully written in my road diary and in
the articles I sent to <i>The Times</i>, I had thought to
postpone issuing my book to some quieter moment
beyond the war. But the days go on, and we are
getting accustomed to live in a state of war; war has
almost become a normal condition of existence. At
first we could do nothing but consider the facts of
the great quarrel of nations and the exploits of the
armies. War for the moment seemed to be our life,
our culture, and our religion. But things have
changed. War started by concentrating us and
making us narrow, but now it is giving us greater
breadth. We have become more interested in the
home life of our Allies, in the &#8220;after-the-war&#8221; prospects
of Europe, in the future of our own British
Empire and of the wide world generally. The war
has given us a larger consciousness, and we have
become, as some say, &#8220;Continental.&#8221; In any case,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span>
we are much less insular. France and Russia have
become real places to the man in the street, and the
account he gives of them is more credible. Even
our country labourer can say where Gallipoli is, Mesopotamia,
Egypt, Salonica, Bulgaria, Serbia, though,
indeed, I have frequently heard the latter spoken of
as Siberia. &#8220;My son&#8217;s gone to Siberia,&#8221; says the
countryman; &#8220;it&#8217;s a cold place.&#8221; Our imagination
ranges farther afield, and young men of all classes
think of making far travels when the war is
over. We are not less interested in other things,
but more; only less interested in the old suffocating
business and industrial life of the time before
the war, of the stuffy rooms, the circumscribed
horizons, the dull grind. All eyes are opened wider,
all hearts have greater hopes, and that which dares in
us dares more. We are reading more, reading better,
and, among other matters, are thinking more of foreign
countries, empires, far-away climes. The war, bringing
so many nations together, has touched imaginations.
It has mixed our themes of conversations and enriched
our life with new colours, new ideas. So, perhaps,
the story of this journey and my impressions of an
interesting but remote portion of the Tsar&#8217;s Empire
will not come amiss just now. Moreover, during the
war many problems have become clearer, especially
those of the British Empire, clearer, but none the
less unsolved, and I feel that a study of a vast stretch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[xi]</span>
of the Russian Empire, and of its problems and its
prospective future, cannot but be helpful.</p>

<p>Among the letters sent me care of <i>The Times</i> there
is one written about an article which has become a
chapter in this book:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Since I was a child and steeped myself in the &#8216;Arabian
Nights,&#8217; I have never been so enthralled as I was by an
article of yours called &#8216;Towards Turkestan,&#8217; which appeared
in <i>The Times</i> long since, as it seems now (last May?). I
am an old, tired recluse. I have been reading for over
sixty years. I&#8217;m very much extinct, but my desert also
blossomed with your roses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Charm <i>inexpressible</i> breathed from the roses (I think
they must have been the black-red sort). Strange figures&mdash;rich
garments, all solemnised by, as it were, a twilight
glamour made of magical influences. All so real, yet remote.
I repeat, I have never been taken away so far since
I was a child. There was another article which I cut out
and lost ... but I did not prize it as I did the Turkestan
article, where figures both bizarre and dignified greeted you
and bade you farewell with roses. And sunset steeps them
in a golden haze. And they still move there whilst the
traveller who has spell-bound them in his writing has gone
on his way....&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>I have printed this letter because it was sweet to
have it, and it touched me. May the roses bloom
again!</p>

<i>Country Life</i> for permission to republish portions of

For these photographs, except those relating to the
Altai, I am chiefly indebted to the professor of French
at Tashkent Military School and to M. Drampof, of
Pishpek. Special permission has to be obtained to
enter Russian Central Asia, and, as I was going on
foot, the possession of a camera might have led to the
suspicion of military spying. So I had my camera
sent to Semipalatinsk, which is in Siberia, and only
used it on the Siberian part of my journey. My
thanks are also due to Mr. Wilton, the courteous and
able correspondent of <i>The Times</i> at Petrograd, who
obtained for me my permit for travel in Russian
Central Asia.</p>

<small>LEAVING VLADIKAVKAZ</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the early spring of 1914 I walked once more to
the Kazbek mountain. It was really too early for
tramping, too cold, but it was on this journey that I
decided what my summer should be. Once you have
become the companion of the road, it calls you and
calls you again. Even in winter, when you have to
walk briskly all day, and there is no sitting on any
bank of earth or fallen tree to write a fragment or
rest, and when there is no sleeping out, but only
the prospect of freezing at some wretched coffee-house
or inn, the road still lies outside the door of your
house full of charm and mystery. You want to know
where the roads lead to, and what may be on them
beyond the faint horizon&#8217;s line.</p>

<p>So it is March, and I am walking out from
Vladikavkaz on the Georgian road, and only on a four
days&#8217; journey&mdash;to the Kazbek mountain and back.
Indeed, the road beyond is probably choked with
snow, and there is no further progress. But I shall
see how the year stands on the Caucasus.</p>

<p>The stillness of the morning&mdash;a circumambient
silence. A consciousness of the silence in the deep of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
space. Three miles of level highway stretch straight
and brown from the city on the steppes to the dark,
blank wall of the mountains. Beyond the black wall
and above it are the snow-mantled superior ranges,
and above all, almost melting into the deep blue of
the Caucasian sky, the glimmering, icy-wet slopes of
the dome of the Kazbek. The sun presides over the
day, and as a personal token burns the brow, even
though the feet tread on patches of crisp snow on the
yellow-green banks of the moor. No lizards basking
in the sun, no insects on the wing, no flowers&mdash;not a
speedwell, not a cowslip, not a snowdrop. Only little
flocks of siskins rising unexpectedly from sun-bathed
hollows like so many fat grasshoppers. Only an
occasional crazy brown leaf that scampers over the
withered fallen grass. There is vapour over the
plumage-like woods on the hills, but no birds are
singing. Nature can almost be described in negation,
she shows so little of her glory; yet she makes the
heart ache the more.</p>

<p>Persian stone-breakers, hammer in hand, sitting on
mats by the side of the heaps of rocks; primitive carts
lumbering with their loads of faggots or maize-straw
or ice; horsemen like centaurs because of their great
black capes joining their head and shoulders to little
Caucasian horses&mdash;that is all the life at this season of
the year of the one great highway over the mountains,
the great military road from Vladikavkaz to Tiflis&mdash;no
motor-cars, no trams, no light-rolling carriages with
gentry in them, no trains.</p>

<p>Stopping at a sunny mound to have lunch, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
hear from a hundred yards away the River Terek like
the sound of a wind in the forest, the impetuous
stream rushing between white crusts of frozen foam
and washing greenly against ice-crowned boulders.
For sixty miles the road is that of the valley of the
Terek. It passes the Redant and then becomes the
visible companion of the river, winding with it among
the primeval grandeur of its rocks. The Kazbek
begins to disappear, hidden by its barrier cliffs&mdash;its
Kremlin; but for a mile or so its snowy cap remains
in sight over the great lopsided, jagged crags. The
blue smokes of Balta and red-roofed nestling Dolinadalin
rise into the afternoon sky. The road enters
the chilling shadow of the Gorge of Jerakhof, and
you look back regretfully on the red sunlit strand
behind you. The white-framed Terek moves in a
grand curve through a broad wilderness of stones and
snow. An icy mountain draught creeps from the
cleft in the grey cold rocks. On the deserted road
the telegraph poles and wires assume that sinister
expression which they have in vast and lonely mountain
tracts. The opening by which you entered the
gorge becomes a purple triangle, and far above you
and behind you glimmers the tobacco-coloured sunlit
Table Mountain.</p>

<p>The road becomes narrower: on the one hand the
river roars among ice-mantled rocks, on the other the
black silt continually trickles and whispers. The faint
crimson of sunset lights the wan towers of Fortoug,
and then one by one the yellow stars come out like
lamps over the mountain walls.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>There are three inns between Vladikavkaz and the
Kazbek mountain. I stayed at the second, at Larse,
and made my supper with some thirty Georgians,
Ossetines, and Russians, workmen on the road and
chance travellers. Here I heard many rumours of
the commercial destiny of the military road, of the
thirty-verst tunnel that it is necessary to make, of
the Englishman named Stewart, the &#8220;Boss of the
Terek&#8221;&mdash;<i>Khosa&iuml;n Tereka</i>&mdash;who has the contract to
supply the whole of the Caucasus with electricity,
who will or will not make an electric power station
in the shadow of Queen Tamara&#8217;s castle, needing an
artificial waterfall three hundred sazhens high.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the project has grown cold,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will come to nothing,&#8221; say the hillmen; &#8220;for
ten years people have been talking of such things,
but nothing has changed except that we have got
poorer.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the host is an optimist. &#8220;It will come.
There will be a tramway from the city to the Kazbek.
The trams will go past my door. We shall have
electric light and electric cooking, and will become
rich.&#8221;</p>

<p>We remained all thirty in one room all night&mdash;square-faced,
gentle, sociable Russians in blouses;
tall, Roman-looking Georgians and Ossetines in long
cloaks, with daggers at their tight waists, with high
sheepskin hats on their heads. They ate voraciously
bread and cheese and black pigs&#8217;-liver, putting the
waste ends when they had finished into the bags of
their winter hoods&mdash;astonishing people to look at,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
these Caucasians; though half-starved, yet of great
stature and iron strength, with fine, broad-topped,
intelligent heads, deeply lined, cunning brows, long,
beak-like, aquiline noses. They would make splendid
soldiers&mdash;but not so good &#8220;soldiers of industry.&#8221;
They are a people who often fail when they go
to America. They all knew men who had gone there
and had returned with stories of unemployment or
exploitation. Scarcely one of them had a good word
to say of America. They all, however, looked forward
to the time when the Caucasus would be developed on
American lines and hum with Western prosperity.
We slept on the tables of the inn, on the bar, in the
embrasures of the windows, on the forms, on sacking
on the floor&mdash;the kerosene lamp was turned low, and
nearly everyone snored.</p>

<p>We were all up before dawn, and I accompanied
an Ossetine miller who was in search of flint for his
mill, and we entered the Gorge of Dariel whilst the
stars were dim in the sky. It was a sharp wintry
morning, and as the road led ever upward and became
ever narrower, the wind was piercing. The leaking
rocks of summer where often I had made my morning
tea were now grown old in the winter, and had wisps
of grey hair hanging down&mdash;yard-long icicles and thick
tangles of ice. The precipitously falling streams and
waterfalls were ice-marble stepping-stones from the
Terek to the mountain-top.</p>

<p>We entered the gorge by the little red bridge
which, like a brace, unites the two sides of the river
at its narrowest point. The stars disappeared. Somewhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
the sun was rising, but his light was only in
the sky so far above. We beheld the green, primeval
ruin of Nature, the red-brown, grey, and green
boulders of Dariel in varied immensity and diversity
of shape, the vast shingly, boulder-strewn wastes, the
adamantine shoulders of porphyry, the cold, ponderous
immensities of rock held over the daring little road,
the river eddies springing like tigers over the central
ledges between fastnesses of ice.</p>

<p>My Ossetine picked up various stones and struck
them with his dagger to see how well they sparked,
and, having apparently found what he wanted,
accepted a lift in an ox-cart and returned back to the
inn at Larse. Perhaps it was too cold for him. I
walked up to the square cliff of Tamara and the
tooth of the wall of the ancient castle where Queen
Tamara treacherously entertained strangers, making
love to them and feasting them, and then having
them murdered; the castle where the devil once
arrived in the guise of such an unlucky wanderer&mdash;the
scene of the story of Lermontof&#8217;s &#8220;Demon.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was once the frontier of Asia, and the
romantic country of a fine fighting people. To this
day, despite railway projects and the hope that the
river may provide the Caucasus with electricity,
Queen Tamara&#8217;s castle remains almost the newest
thing. It is modern beside the antiquity and majesty
of the ruin of Nature. Here the real world seems to
jut out through the green turf and flower-carpeted
earth into the light of day, striking us awfully, like
the apparition of God the Father coming up out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
the bowers of Eden. You feel yourself in the
presence of something even older than mankind
itself, and you wonder what differences you would
note if, with the goloshes of Fortune on your feet,
you could be transported back a thousand years, a
second thousand, a third thousand, and so on. What
did the Ancients make of this? They held that it was
to the Kazbek mountain that Prometheus was bound
as a punishment for stealing fire from heaven. Was
that what they said when they first came fearfully
through and discovered the plains of the North?</p>

<p>An ancient way! And then at the turn of it, the
gate to the &#8220;Kremlin&#8221; of Dariel, and the towering
Kazbek lifting itself to the sky within. Here is truly
one of the most wonderful and romantic regions in
the world. But it was not to see the Kazbek that I
made this journey, but to find again a certain cave
where years ago I found my companion on the road,
the place where we lived and slept by the side of the
river. It was there as I left it, familiar, calm, by
the side of the running river, glittering in the noon-day
sun, and the granite boulders held threads of ice
and ice-pearls&mdash;the ear-rings of the rocks. And I
would have liked to meet my companion again. But
Heaven knew under what part of its canopy the tramp
was wandering then. I felt a home-sickness to be
tramping again, and I decided that as soon as the
snow and ice had gone I would take to the road.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And so, the season having changed, and the cold
winds and rains of spring giving way to summer, I take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
the road once more into new country. The season really
changes when it is possible to sleep comfortably out of
doors. This year I go into the depths of the Russian
East, and, besides taking the adventures of the road,
continue my study of Easternism and Westernism in
the Tsar&#8217;s Empire. I travel by train to Tashkent, the
limit of the railway, and then take the road, with my
pack on my back, through the deserts of Sirdaria and
the Land of the Seven Rivers towards the limits of
Chinese Tartary and Pamir, then along the Chinese
frontier, north to the Altai mountains and the
steppes of Southern Siberia. This is a long, new
journey&mdash;new for English experience&mdash;because, until
our entente with Russia, mutual jealousy about the
Indian frontier made it extremely difficult for the
Russian Government to permit observant and adventurous
Englishmen to wander about as I intend to
do. Indeed, even now I may be stopped and turned
back from some forlorn spot seven or eight hundred
miles from a railway station, and then, perhaps, silence
may engulf my correspondence for a time. All things
may happen; my papers may be confiscated or lost in
the post, or my progress may be stopped by various
accidents. In any case, I have official permission for
my journey, and the weather is fine.</p>

<p>The old grandmother baked me a box of sweet
cheesecakes (<i>vatrushki</i>), Vassily Vassilitch brought me
fruit and chocolate, another friend brought three dozen
cabbage pies&mdash;thus one always starts out for the wilderness.
We assembled in the grandmother&#8217;s sitting-room
to say good-bye. I am to beware of earthquakes, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
snakes, of having much money on my person, of being
bitten by scorpions, of tigers, wolves, bears, of occult
experiences.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is occult country,&#8221; said G&mdash;&mdash;, teacher of
mathematics in the &#8220;Real School.&#8221; &#8220;You are likely
to have occult adventures; some enormous catacylsm is
going to take place this summer. I don&#8217;t know what
it is, but I should advise you to get across this dangerous
country as soon as you can. Siberia is safe, and North
Russia, but not Central Asia, and not, as a matter of
fact, Germany.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had had a strange dream, and, being of occult
preoccupation, ventured on vague prophecy, which
generally took the form of earthquakes and catacylsms.
When I met him in the autumn after my journey,
the great war with Germany had broken out, and I
was inclined to credit him with a true prophecy; but,
with honest wilfulness, he was still figuring out earthquakes
and cataclysms to be, and would not have it
that the European conflagration was the fulfilment of
his dream.</p>

<p>Another friend is charmed with the idea that I am
going to Bokhara, and won&#8217;t I bring her home a silk
scarf from the great bazaars? Another is touched by
the dream that I am realising. To him Central Asia
is a fairyland, and the Thian Shan mountains are not
real mountains so much as mountains in a book of
legends.</p>

<p>At last the old grandmother says:</p>

<p>&#8220;All sit down!&#8221;</p>

<p>And we sit, and are silent together for a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
moments, then rise and turn to the Ikon and cross
ourselves. The grandmother marks me in the sign of
the Cross and blesses me, praying that I may achieve
my journey and come safely back, that no harm may
overtake me, and that I may have success. Then I pass
to each of the others present and say &#8220;Good-bye.&#8221;
Vera, however, looks at me in such a way that I am
sure she means that she feels I shall never return. So
I am bound to ask myself: Is not this farewell a final
farewell? Does not this Russian see something that
is going to happen to me? But she has been very kind
to me, and just at parting puts a beautiful Ikon-print
into my hand, and I fix it in the inside of the cover of
my stiff map.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The train from Vladikavkaz wanders along the
northern side of the Caucasus, unable to find a pass
over the mountains. The meadows as far as eye can
see are yellowed with cowslips. Now and then a derrick
tells that you are in the oil region, and in an hour or
so the train steams into the pavement-shed station that
marks the weariness and mud of Grozdny, capital of
the North Caucasian oilfields. There is a breath of salt
air at Petrovsk, a few hours later, and you realise that
you have reached the Caspian shore. All night long
the train runs along to Baku, glad, as it were, to turn
south at last and get round the Caucasus it cannot cross.
At Baku I change and take steamer across the Caspian
Sea to Krasnovodsk, on the salt steppes, but I have a
whole day to wait in the city.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, you come to Baku to make money.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
There is nothing to tempt you there otherwise. In
windy weather you are blinded with clouds of flying
sand; in the heat of summer you are stifled with kerosene
odours. It is a commercial city without glamour.
Though it boasts several millionaires and is an important
name in every financial newspaper in the world, it has
no public works, nothing by virtue of which it can take
its stand as a Western city. The working men are
very badly paid&mdash;that is, according to our Western
standards&mdash;and they do not obtain the few advantages
of industrial civilisation that ought to come to make
up for dreary life and health lost. There is a constant
ferment amongst the labouring classes in the
city, and repeated strikes, even in war time. Baku,
again, is one of the last refuges of the horse tram
and the kerosene street-lamp. It is only in the
eastern quarter that the town has charm. There
you may see strings of camels loping up the steep
streets, panniers on their worn, furry backs, Persians
squatting between the panniers, contentedly bobbing
up and down with the movement of the beast. Or you
may watch the camels kneeling to be loaded, crying
appealingly as the heavy burdens are put on them,
cumbrously lifting themselves again, hind-legs first,
and joining the waiting knot of camels already
loaded.</p>

<p>The great shopping place&mdash;the bazaar&mdash;is wholly
Eastern, and even more characteristic than in Russia
proper. I feel how the bazaar and the ways of the
bazaar came to Russia from the East. As you go from
stall to stall you are besieged by porters holding empty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
baskets&mdash;they want to be hired to walk behind you
and carry your purchases as you make them. Characters
of the Arabian Nights, these; and yet in the
streets of Warsaw and Kief, and many other cities,
those men in red hats and brass badges, who sit on the
kerb or on doorsteps waiting for passers-by to hire
them, are really the lineal Westernised descendants of
the tailor&#8217;s fifth brother&mdash;I think it was the fifth
brother who was a porter.</p>

<p>In the harbour, at the pier where my boat is waiting,
I watch the Persian dockers working. Real slaves
they are, working twelve hours a day for 1s. 4d. (60
copecks). They have straw-stuffed pack carriers on
their backs, like the saddling of camels, and the
rhythm of their movement as they proceed with their
burdens from the warehouse to the ship is that of
slavery. The name of slavery has gone, but the fact
remains. Still, the European is not awakened to pity.
The Persians are the human camels, work hardest of
all the people of the East, and are the least discontented.
They are singing and crying and calling
all the time they work. The East slaves for the
West, but still is not much influenced by the West.
It is not they who cause the strikes.</p>

<p>Just before the time for my boat to leave another
boat arrives from Lenkoran, and out of it come a party
of Persian men with carpet bags slung across their
shoulders, their wives in black veils, many-coloured
cloaks, and baggy cotton trousers, their children all
carrying earthenware pots. More labour available on
the docks, more homes occupied in the little houses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
that dot the eight-mile crescent of the mountainous
city of Baku.</p>

<p>The boat leaves at nightfall. It is the <i>Skobelef</i>, a
handsome steamer, built in Antwerp in 1902. It must
have been brought to the Caspian along the waterways
of Europe; an officer on board ventures the opinion
that it was brought to Baku in parts and fitted up
there. A pleasant ship, however it was brought&mdash;considerably
superior to the ordinary American lake-steamer,
for instance. There were very few passengers,
and these lay down to sleep at once, fearing the storm
that was blowing, so I remained alone on deck and
watched the retreating shore. Leaving Europe for
America, you sit up in the prow and look ahead,
over the ocean; at least, you do not sit and watch
the Irish coast disappear. But leaving Europe for
Asia, you sit aft and watch her to the last. And
the retreating lights of Baku are the lights of
Europe.</p>

<p>The night is very dark and starless, and so the eight-mile
semicircle of lights is wonderful to behold; the
handsome lanterns of the pier, the lights of the esplanade,
of the three variety theatres, of the cinemas and
shops, the thousands of sparks of homes on the mountain-side.
This is the real beginning of my journey,
and it is very thrilling; good to sit in the wind and
feel the movement of the sea; good to watch the many
lighthouses turning red, then green, in the night, and
to pass within ten yards of a little lamp, just over the
surface of the sea, alternately going out and bursting
into brightness every thirty seconds. The lamp seems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
to say: &#8220;There is danger ... there is danger,&#8221; and
it whispers joyful intelligence to the heart.</p>

<p>There is trouble on the water as we reach the open
sea, and the boat begins to roll, but it is still pleasant
on the upper deck, and the high wind is warm.</p>

<p>The lights of Baku and Europe have been gradually
erased. First to go were the sparks of the homes on
the mountain-side, then the lights of the esplanade;
the eight great lamps of the pier remain, and one by
one they disappear till there is only the great yellow-green
flasher that tells ships coming into the harbour
just where Baku is. That also disappears at last, and
it begins to rain heavily. So I go down to my berth
to sleep.</p>

<p>Next morning the wide green sea was sunlit and
flecked with white crests of turning waves. Looking
out of a port-hole, I saw the bright light of morning
shining on the grey and accidental-looking mountains
of Asia. The boat was coming into Krasnovodsk.</p>

<small>WHERE THE DESERT BLOSSOMS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">KRASNOVODSK is one of the hottest, most
desert, and miserable places in the world. The
mountains are dead; there is no water in them.
Rain scarcely ever falls, and the earth is only sand
and salt. Strange that even there there is a season of
spring, and little shrubs peep forth in green and live
three weeks or a month before they are finally scorched
up. I spent the day with a kind Georgian to whom
I had a letter; a shipping agent at the harbour.
He was to have helped me, supposing the local
<i>gendarmerie</i> should stop my landing. But by an
amusing chance I escaped the inspecting officer&#8217;s
attention, and got into Transcaspia without questions
or passport-showing. One can never be quite
sure of passing, even when one&#8217;s papers are in order.
The Russian Government does not give a written passport
for Central Asia, but transmits your name to all
the local authorities, and you have to trust, first, to
their having received your name and, second, to their
agreeing that the name received in its Russian spelling
is the same as yours written in English on your
British passport. In the case of a name such as mine,
which is spelt one way and pronounced another, there
is likely to be difficulties. During my stay in Central<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
Asia, moreover, I saw my name spelt in the following
cheerful ways&mdash;Grkhazkn, Groyansk, and, of
course, the inevitable Graggam, and on some occasions
I had the difficult task of persuading Russian
officials that the names were one and the same. Still,
they were inclined to be lenient.</p>

<p>The Georgian was very hospitable; he took me
from the pier to his house, behind six or seven wilted
and tired acacia trees, gave me a bedroom, bade the
samovar and coffee for me; and I made my breakfast
and then slept the three hot hours of the day. In
the evening he brought up his other Caucasian compatriots
from the settlement, a little band of exiles,
and we talked many hours to the tune of the humming
samovar. We talked of Vladikavkaz and the Kazbek
beloved of Georgians, and of my tramps and of mutual
acquaintances in Caucasian towns and villages, talked
of ethics and politics, and the working man, and of
Russia, especially of modern Russia, with its bourgeois
and the evil town life. Mine host had almost Victorian-English
sentiments, did not like the slit skirt and
Tango stocking&mdash;so evident in Baku, did not know
what women were coming to&mdash;despised the Russians
for their flirting and dancing and gay living, believed
in quiet family life as the foundation of personal
happiness, and in Socialism as the foundation of
political blessedness. The lights of Europe had not
quite disappeared.</p>

<p>As the train did not leave till twelve, we had a
long and pleasant evening, and when the time came
to go mine host brought me a big bottle of Kakhetian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
wine, and we all went together to the railway station.
I got my ticket, found my carriage. No commotion,
no excitement, the empty midnight train crept out
of the station, over the salt steppes, and I felt as if
in the whole long train there was only myself. It
was very vexatious, leaving in the shadow of dark
night when no landscape was visible, but there was
consolation in the fact that the train accomplished
no more than seventy-five miles before sunrise. Next
morning, directly I awakened, I looked out of the
train, and there before my gaze was the desert;
yellow-brown sand as far as eye could see, and on the
horizon the enigmatical silhouette of a string of camels,
looking like a scrap of Eastern handwriting between
earth and heaven. A new sight in front of me, for
I had never seen the desert before, except, of course,
in Palestine, where it is hardly characteristic. The
cliffs of Krasnovodsk had disappeared; the desert was
on either hand. I looked in vain for a house or a
tree anywhere, but I saw again, as at Krasnovodsk,
Nature&#8217;s pathetic little effort to make a home&mdash;an
occasional yellow thistle in bloom, a wan pink in
blossom here and there on the sand. The train was
going so slowly that it seemed possible to step down
on to the plain, pick a flower, and return.</p>

<p>Strange that the Russian Government should take
railways over the desert before it has developed its
home trade routes! The Western mind would find
this railway almost inexplicable. You might almost
take it to be an elaborate game of make-believe.
The train is scheduled in the time-table among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
fast trains, and yet at successive empty desert
stations stops 21, 31, 14, 6, 12, 12 minutes respectively,
and takes 23 hours to traverse the 390 miles
from Krasnovodsk to Askhabad, an average rate
of 17 miles an hour. The reason for this slowness
lies, perhaps, in the fact that the sleepers are not
very well laid, and would be dislodged if greater
speed were attempted; and the stops at the stations
are impressive, indulge a Russian taste for getting
out of trains and having a look round, and also,
incidentally, let the wild natives know that the steam
caravan is waiting for them if they want to go.
We stop longer at one of these blank desert stations
than the Nord express at Berlin or a Chicago express
at Niagara. Russia is not excited about loss of time.
Time may be money in America; it is only copper
money in Russia, and it is more interesting to have
a political railway across the deserts of Asia than to
help the fruit-growers of Abkhasia or to functionise
industrially the vast railwayless North.</p>

<p>It is dull travelling, but hills at length appear&mdash;the
lesser Balkans, the greater Balkans; salt marshes give
way to sandbanks&mdash;drifts of sand heaped up and shaped
by the wind like grey snowdrifts. The beautiful curving
lines of the sandbanks are wind runes. All this
district was once the bed of the Caspian Sea, or, rather,
of an ocean which, it is surmised, stretched on the one
hand to beyond the Aral Sea, and on the other to the
Azof and the Black Sea. The mountains were islands
or shores or dangerous rocks in the sea.</p>

<p class="caption">THE CENTRAL ASIAN RAILWAY: NEARING THE OXUS</p>

<p>When we had passed the Balkans the country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
improved <i>by bits</i>. Suddenly, far away, a patch of
green appeared, and one&#8217;s eye hailed it as one at sea
hails land. When the train drew nearer there came
into view a wonderful emerald square thick with young
wheat, set in the absolute grey and brown of the wilderness.
This was the first irrigated field. Soon a second
and a third field appeared in blessed contrast and
refreshment. Out of the yellowish, cloudy sky the sun
burst free, and I remembered that it was the first of
May. So May Day commenced for me.</p>

<p>People began to appear at the stations, which up
till then had been desolate; stately Turkomans, wearing
from shoulders to ankles red and white <i>khalati</i>,
bath-robes rather than dresses; Tekintsi, in hats of
white, brown or black sheepskin, hats as big and
bigger than the bearskins of our Grenadiers; fat,
broad-lipped Kirghiz, with Mongolian brows and rat-tail
moustachios drooping to their close-cropped beards;
poor Bactrian labourers, in many colours; rich Persian
merchants, in sombre black. Many women stood at
the stations with hot, just-boiled eggs, with roast
chickens, milk or koumis in bottles, even with pats of
butter, with samovars. And there were native boys
with baskets heaped full of <i>lepeshki</i> (cakes of bread).
Each station was provided with a long barrier, and
the women, in lines of twenty or thirty, stood behind
their wares and cried to the passengers. The many
steaming samovars were a welcome sight, and at the
charge of a halfpenny I made myself tea at one of them.</p>

<p>The country steadily improved, and the train passed
by fields along whose every furrow little artificial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
streams were trickling, past many more emerald wheatfields
surrounded by big dykes. The yellow dust of this
desert needs only water to make it abundantly fertile;
it is not merely frayed rock and stone, as the sand of
the seashore, but an organic substance which has been
settling from the atmosphere for ages&mdash;the <i>lessovaya
zemlya</i>. When we realise that there is of this strange
dust a coat deep enough to be a soil, we understand
something of the antiquity of the desert and the fact
that, when we consider geological history, our mind
must range over millions of years, whereas in thinking
of the history of man we are almost aghast to think
of thousands of years. So the <i>leoss</i> dust settles out
of the clear air. Incidentally, what else may not be
settling out of the air into the every-day of our world?
The spring flowers show the richness of this dust of
the wilderness, for now behold the desert under the
influence of irrigation blooming as the rose. It does,
indeed, actually blossom with the rose, for I notice
even on the fringe of the hopeless desert the sweet-briar,
and it is unusually lovely. At the new stations
little children appear, having in their hands little
clusters of deep crimson blossoms. Poppies now
appear on the waste, irises, saxifrages, mulleins, toadflax&mdash;the
voice of a rich country crying in the midst
of the sand. Here it is literally true:</p>

<p class="caption">THE CENTRAL ASIAN DESERT</p>

<p>By evening the train is running along the frontier
of the north of Persia, and every house has a garden of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
roses. A Persian silk merchant, all in black, with a
talisman of green jade hanging from a gold chain round
his neck, comes into my carriage, and prepares to
occupy the upper shelf. He is travelling all night to
Merv, and has brought a great bouquet of sweet-smelling,
double roses into the carriage. A knobbly-nosed,
grey-faced, animal-eared, antediluvian old sort,
this Persian would not stay in my carriage because
there was a woman in it, but asked me to keep his place
while he went and locked himself in the empty women&#8217;s
compartment next door. He left his black, horn-handled,
slender, leather-wrapped walking-stick behind&mdash;its
ferrule was of brass, and seven inches long.</p>

<p>We reached Geok-Tepe, a great fortress of the
Tekintsi, reduced by Skobelef in 1881. At the railway
station there is a room in which are preserved specimens
of all the weapons used in the fight. There are also
waxwork representations of a Russian soldier with his
gun, and a native soldier cutting the air with his semicircle
of a sword. Many passengers turned out to have
a look at these things. It was sunset time, and the
west was glowing red behind the train, the evening air
was full of health and fragrance, the stars were like
magnesium lights in the lambent heaven, the young
moon had the most wonderful place in the sky, poised
and throned not right overhead, but some degrees from
the zenith, as it were on the right shoulder of the night.</p>

<p>It was an evening that touched the heart. At every
station to Askhabad the passengers descended from the
train, and walked up and down the platforms and
talked. The morning of May Day had been blank and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
dismal; the evening was full of gaiety and life. We
reached Askhabad, the first great city of Turkestan,
about eleven o&#8217;clock at night, and its platform presented
an extraordinary scene. The whole forty-five minutes
of our stay it was crowded with all the peoples of
Central Asia&mdash;Persians, Russians, Afghans, Tekintsi,
Bokharese, Khivites, Turkomans&mdash;and everyone had
in his hand, or on his dress, or in his turban roses. The
whole long pavement was fragrant with rose odours.
Gay Russian girls, all in white and in summer hats,
were chattering to young officers, with whom they
paraded up and down, and they had roses in their
hands. Persian hawkers, with capacious baskets of pink
and white roses, moved hither and thither; immense
and magnificent Turkomans lounged against pillars or
walked about, their bare feet stuck into the mere toe-places
they call slippers&mdash;they, too, held roses in their
fingers. In the third-class waiting-room was a line of
picturesque giants waiting for their tickets, and kept
in order meanwhile by a cross little Russian gendarme.
Behind the long barrier, facing the waiting train, stood
the familiar band of women with chickens and eggs,
with steaming samovars and bottles of hot milk. They
had now candle lanterns and kerosene lamps, and the
light glimmered on them and on the steam escaping
from the boiling water they were selling. I walked out
into the umbrageous streets, where triple lines of
densely foliaged trees cast shadow between you and the
beautiful night sky; in depths of dark greenery lay the
houses of the city, with grass growing on their far-projecting
roofs, with verandas on which the people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
sleep, even in May. But they were not asleep in Askhabad.
I stopped under a poplar and listened to the
sad music of the Persian pipes. In these warm, throbbing,
yet melancholy strains the night of North Persia
was vocal&mdash;the night of my May Day.</p>

<p>I returned to the station and bought a large bunch
of pink and white roses, and, as the second bell had
rung, got back to my carriage, laid my plaid and my
pillow, and as the train went out I slipped away from
the wonderful city&mdash;to a happy dream.</p>

<small>WONDERFUL BOKHARA</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE promise of Persia was not fulfilled on the
morrow after my train left Askhabad. We
turned north-east, and passed over the lifeless,
waterless waste of Kara-Kum, 100 miles of tumbled
desert and loose sand. At eleven in the morning
the temperature was 80 in the shade&mdash;each carriage
in the train was provided with a thermometer&mdash;and
the air was charged with fine dust, which found
its way into the train despite all the closed windows
and closed doors. Through the window the gaze
ranged over the utmost disorder&mdash;yellow shores, all
ribbed as if left by the sea, sand-smoking hillocks,
hollows specked with faint grasses where the marmot
occasionally popped out of sight. At one point on the
passage across we came to mud huts, with Tekintsi
standing by them, and to a reach of the desert where
a herd of ragged-looking dromedaries were finding food
where no other animal would put its nose. Then we
passed away into uninterrupted flowerless sandhills, all
yellow and ribbed by the wind. So, all the way to the
red Oxus River. It is called the Amu-Darya now, but
it is the ancient Oxus, a fair, broad stream at Chardzhui,
but, from its colour, more like a river of red size than
of water. All the canals and dykes of the irrigation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
system of the district flow with the red water of the
river, and wherever the water is conducted the desert
blossoms like virgin soil. The river is the sun&#8217;s wife,
and the green fields are their children.</p>

<p>Chardzhui, the port on the Oxus, is the point for
embarkation for Khiva. There is a small fleet of
Government steamers plying between the two cities,
though it is comparatively difficult for travellers on
private business to obtain a passage on one of them.
When first this fleet was started there was some idea
that Russia would use them in her imperial warfare
as she pushed south, but probably the vessels have
little military significance nowadays. For the rest,
Chardzhui is famous for its melons, which grow to the
size of pumpkins and are very sweet. Frequently in
Petrograd shops or in fashionable restaurants one may
see enormous melons hanging from straps of bast&mdash;these
are the fruits of Chardzhui. At this season of
the year Chardzhui has a great deal of mud and does
not invite travellers, especially as its inns are bad.</p>

<p>The train entered the Russian Protectorate of
Bokhara, and the population changed. From Askhabad
the natives had special cattle-trucks afforded
them, and they sat on planks stretched over trestles;
they were Sarts, Bokharese, Jews, Afghans. Into my
carriage came two Mohammedan scholars going to Bokhara
city. They washed their hands, spread carpets on
one side of the carriage, knelt on the other, said their
prayers, prostrated themselves. Then they took out
a copy of the Koran, and one read to the other in a
sonorous and poetical voice all the way to the city&mdash;they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
were Sarts, a very ancient tribe of Aryan extraction,
some of the finest-looking people of Central Asia, tall,
dignified, wrinkled, wearing gorgeous cloaks and snowy
turbans. The two in my carriage had, apparently,
several wives in another compartment, as they each
carried a sheaf of tickets. The women hereabout were
very strictly in their <i>charchafs</i>. There was no peeping
out or peering round the corner, such as one sees in
Turkey, but an absolute black, blotting out of face and
form. When you looked at five or six sitting patiently
side by side, each and all in voluminous green cloaks,
and where the faces should appear a black mask the
colour and appearance of an oven-shelf, you felt a
horror as if the gaze had rested on corpses or on the
plague-stricken.</p>

<p>From the Oxus valley the people swarmed in a
populous land, and it was a sight to see so many
Easterns drinking green tea from yellow basins.
Already we were nearer China than Russia, and the
sight took me back in memory to Chinatown, New
York, and the <i>chop suey</i> restaurants. I fell into conversation
with a Tartar merchant in carpets, and I
tried to obtain an idea of what Bokhara was like in
the year of grace 1914.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there an electric tramway in Bokhara, or a
horse tramway?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, nothing of the sort. The streets are so
narrow, two carts can&#8217;t pass one another without
collision.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are there any hotels?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are caravanserai.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>&#8220;No European buildings?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only outside the town. There is a Russian police-station,
and a hotel built for officials. The Emir won&#8217;t
allow any hotels to be built within the walls.&#8221;</p>

<p>At length we reached New Bokhara, the Russian
town, with its white houses, avenues of trees, its
broad streets, and shops, and we changed to a by-line
for Ancient Bokhara. The train drew through
pleasant meadows and cornfields, bright and fertile
as the South of England, and after twelve sunny
versts we came into view of the cement-coloured mud
walls of the most wonderful city of Mohammedan Asia,
a place that might have been produced for you by
enchantment&mdash;that reminds you of Aladdin&#8217;s palace as
it must have appeared in the desert to which the
magician transported it. Within toothed walls&mdash;a grey
Kremlin eight miles round&mdash;live 150,000 Mohammedans,
entirely after their own hearts, without any
appreciable interference from without, in narrow
streets, in covered alleys, with endless shops, behind
screening walls. The roads are narrow and cobbled,
and wind in all directions, with manifold alleys and
lanes, with squares where stand handsome mosques,
with portals and stairways leading down to the cool
and tree-shaded, but stagnant, little reservoirs that hold
the city&#8217;s water. Along the roadway various equipages
come prancing&mdash;muddy <i>proletkas</i>, unhandy-looking,
egg-shaped carts, with clumsy wooden wheels eight feet
high, and projecting axles, gilt and crimson-covered
carts made of cane and straw, the shape of a huge egg
that has had both ends sliced off. The Bek, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
Bokharese magistrate, comes bounding along in his
carriage, with outriders, and all others give him salute
as he passes. It is noticeable that the drivers of vehicles
prefer to squat on the horses rather than sit in drivers&#8217;
seats. Strings of laden camels blunder on the cobbles,
innumerable Mohammedans come, mounted on asses&mdash;it
is clear that man is master when you see an immense
Bokharese squatting on a meek ass and holding a huge
cudgel over its head. Charchaffed women are even seen
on asses, and some of them carry a child in front of
them. There are continually deadlocks in the narrow
lanes, and all the time the drivers shout &#8220;<i>Hagh,
hagh!</i>&#8221; (&#8220;Get out of the way, get out of the
way!&#8221;)</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_028.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">BOKHARA: THE ESCORT OF A MAGISTRATE</p>

<p>The houses are made of the ruins of bygone houses,
of ancient tiles and mud. They have fine old doors of
carven wood, but no windows looking on the streets.
A sort of inlaid cupboard, with a glass window, half
open, a spread of wares, and a Moslem sitting in the
midst, is a shop. Thus sits the vendor of goods, but
also the maker&mdash;the tinsmith at work, the coppersmith,
the maker of hats. The bazaars are rich and rare, and
in the shadow of the covered streets&mdash;there are fifty of
them&mdash;the lustrous silks and carpets, and pots and
slippers, in the shops each side of the way, have an
extraordinary magnificence; the gorgeous vendors, sitting
patiently, not asking you to buy, staring at the
heaps of metallics, silver-bits and notes resting on the
little tabourets in front of them, belong to an age which
I thought was only to be found in books. What a
wealthy city it is! It offers more silks and carpets for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
sale than London or Paris; it is an endless warehouse
of covetable goods.</p>

<p>What strikes you at Jerusalem or Constantinople is
the abundance of English goods for sale, but here at
Bokhara there is a strange absence of Western commodities.
Formerly the English sent all sorts of manufactures
by the caravan road from India, but since the
Russians ringed round their Customs system the commercial
influence of England has waned. Western
goods come via Russia. What European articles there
are come from Germany or Scandinavia. For the
rest, as in other Eastern cities, the street arabs hawk
churek-cakes and <i>lepeshki</i>; men in white sit at corners
selling, in this case, <i>Bokharese</i> delight, brown twists
of toffee, old-fashioned sugar-candy which in piles
looks like so much rock crystal. Beggars in rags
sit outside the mosques and hold up to you Russian
basins&mdash;they do not, however, cry and clamour and
follow you, as in the tourist-visited cities of Asia
Minor and North Africa. Outside every other shop
is a bird-cage and a large pet bird; in some cases
falcons, much prized in these lands. I admired the
falcons, and their owners seemed childishly pleased at
the attention I gave them. I gave a piece of Bokharese
silver to a beggar outside a mosque (the
Bokharese have their own silver coinage, which, however,
looks like ancient coin rather than any which is
now in use). In one of the big shadowy bazaars I
bought a delicious silk scarf of old-rose colour full of
light and loveliness, falling into a voluminous grandeur
as the melancholy Eastern showed it me. I did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
bargain about its price, that seemed almost impossible,
only five roubles (ten shillings), and the lady who has
it now says it is enough to make a whole robe. Somehow
I liked it better as a scarf than I could if it were
&#8220;made up.&#8221;</p>

<p>I passed out of the city and walked round the walls.
A road encompasses them, and on the road are camels
with blue beads on their necks and many Easterns
riding them. There is a strange feeling of contrast
in being outside the city. The arc of the grey walls
goes gradually round and away from you, surrounding
and enclosing the life of the city; the city is like a
magical box full of strange magicians and singers and
toy shop-men and customers; it is like a strange
human beehive full of life. And outside the walls
there is the sudden contrast of fresh air and space
and life and greenery and broad sky. Inside the city
the streets are so narrow that you feel the &#8220;box&#8221; has
got the lid on. Someone said to me when I went to
New York: &#8220;We&#8217;ll give you the freedom of the
city with the lid off.&#8221; Well, Bokhara has the lid
<i>on</i>. And you feel that certainly when you get outside
and look at the silent, significant enclosing wall.
But the fields are deep in verdure, and it is like
a lovely June day in England&mdash;the willow leaning
lovingly over you, overwhelmed with leaves. The walls
are battlemented, rent, patched up, buttressed; there
are eleven gates, and at each gate the traffic going in
and out has a processional aspect. Along the walls,
between gate and gate, there is a deep and gentle peace.
No sound comes through the walls; they are broad and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
high and solid. The swallows nesting there twitter.
You cannot obtain a glimpse, even of the high mosques
within.</p>

<p>I entered the city once more, lost myself in its
mazes, and was obliged to take a native cab in order
to get out again. I was living outside the town in
an inn specially built for men on Government service.
I got the last empty room. Pleasant it was to lie
back in the sun and be carried along twenty wonderful
streets and lanes, seeing once more all I had seen
before of colour and Orientalism.</p>

<p>The Bokharese are a gentle people. They wear no
weapons. They sit in the grass market and chatter and
smile over their basins of tea. The little pink doves of
the streets search between their bare feet for crumbs.
The wild birds of the desert build in the walls of their
houses and bazaars. On the top of the tower of every
other mosque is an immense storks&#8217; nest, overlapping
the turret on all sides. Some of these nests must be
eight to ten feet high; they are round, and so look like
part of the design of the architecture. Storks are
encouraged to build there by the Mohammedans, by
whom they are held sacred. It is pleasant to watch
the bird itself, standing on one leg, a black but living
and moving silhouette against the sky; to listen to
the clatter of bills when the father stork suddenly flies
down to a nest with food.</p>

<p>Bokhara is a sort of Mussulman perfection&mdash;there
is no progress to be obtained there except after the
destruction of old forms. The Bokharese keep to the
forms of their religion and its ethical laws; they wear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
their clothes correctly; they know their crafts. They
are a great contrast to the Russians, who are careless
and inexact, and in their worship often nonchalant to
their God; to the Russians, who wear nothing correctly
and come out in almost any sort of attire; to the
Russians, so ignorant and clumsy in their crafts.
Yet Russia has all before her, and Bokhara has all
behind her.</p>

<p>The Bokharese have no ambition; civilisation and
mechanical progress do not tempt them. They have a
happy smile for everything that comes along, but
nothing moves them. A Russian motor-car comes
bounding over the cobbles, whooping and coughing its
alarm signals; a score of dogs try to set on it and bite
it as it passes, and the natives sit in their cupboard
shops and laugh. If the car stops, they do not collect
round it, as would a village of Caucasian tribesmen, for
instance. There was one Bokharian&mdash;a Sart, in full
cloak and turban&mdash;who rode a bicycle, an astonishing
exception.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_032.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">OUTSIDE ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS OF THE MOSQUES</p>

<p>The Russians at present hold Bokhara very lightly,
but will no doubt tighten their hands on it later, as
they are taking the solidification of their Central Asian
Empire very seriously. At present there are no passports,
and there is mixed money; but passports are
coming in, and the banks are taking up all the ancient
Sartish bits they can get and giving Russian silver in
exchange. There are several Russian banks within the
city walls, and they have a great influence. The Emir
is friendly towards Russia, and is a pompous figure at
the Russian Court, though it is rumoured that in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
native palaces he whiles the long empty day away by
playing such elementary card games as <i>durak</i>, snap,
and happy family. The Russians have permission to
build schools in the city, and the Russian bricklayer is
to be seen at work with trowel and line, whilst the
native navvy carries the hod to and fro. The foreign
goods in the bazaar are mostly cotton, and if you
examine the splendidly gay prints that go to form the
clothing of the natives you find it is all marked Moscow
manufacture. The Bokharese merchants go to Nizhni
Fair not only to sell, but to buy. There are no
English in the streets, no tourists, no Americans.
Indeed, I asked myself once in wonder: Where are
the Americans? The only people in Western attire
are commercial travellers (<i>commer&ccedil;ants</i>), and they are
mostly Russians or Armenians, though Germans are
occasionally to be seen. I noticed knots of these men
discussing prices of horsehair, wool, oil-cake, carpets,
silks. It should be remembered that that district is
more justly famous for its carpets than for its silks.
The best carpets in the world are made by the
Tekintsi. Armenians, Turkomans and Persians work in
whole villages and settlements in Transcaspia making
carpets with needle and loom. They have the original
tradition of carpet-making, a sense for the particular
art of weaving those wonderful patterns of Persia, and
for them a carpet is not a covering on which it could
be possible to imagine a man walking with muddy
boots; it is for dainty naked feet in the harem, or it
is a whole picture to be hung on a wall, not thrown
on the floor. Singer&#8217;s sewing machines are, of course,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
installed at Bokhara; they are in every town in the
wide world. The cinema also has come, and a green
poster announces that the Tango will be shown after
the presentation of a striking comedy called &#8220;The
Suffragette.&#8221;</p>

<p>But what does this really matter? Let us ask the
deliberate stork, standing on one leg on the height of
the mosque of Lava-Khedei. The mosque tower has
a clock, and the stork seems to be trying to read the
time. But he will give no answer, nor will the Mussulmans
below; they also are scanning the wall to see if
it is nearer the hour to pray. And the clock, be it
observed, is not set by Petrograd time.</p>

<small>MOHAMMEDAN CITIES AND MOHAMMEDANISM</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE consideration of the wonderful Moslem cities,
Constantinople, Cairo, Jerusalem and Bokhara,
with their marvellous blending of colours, their characteristic
covered ways and bazaars, their great spreads of
lace and silk and carpets, slippers, fezes, turbans, copper
ware, their gloomy stone ways and close courts, their
blind houses, made windowless that their women be not
seen, their great mosques and splendid tombs, inevitably
suggests a great question of the East. What is
Mohammedanism, what does it mean? At Cairo and
Jerusalem, and even at Constantinople, it is possible to
doubt the real nature of the Moslem world; it seems a
makeshift world giving way readily to Western influence,
or, in any case, reproved by the more splendid
and vital institutions of the West standing side by side
with many shabby and wretched phenomena of the
East.</p>

<p>But Bokhara is a perfect place. It is much more
remote even than Delhi, and is almost untouched,
unaffected by Western life. It is a city of a dream,
and if a magician wished to transport some modern
Aladdin to a fairy city, where there would be nothing
recognisable and yet everything would be beautiful and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
bewildering, he need only bring him to the walls of
Bokhara. Through Bokhara and its undisturbed peace
and beauty, one obtains a new vision of Mohammedanism,
and it becomes absurd to think that the real
Moslem world is of the same pattern as the Westernised
and yet strangely picturesque cities with which we are
familiar. We remember the fact that there are so many
millions more Mohammedans than there are Christians,
that they live off the railways, in deserts, in far away
and remote cities, that they journey on camels and in
caravans, and that to them their religion and way of
life are sufficient, that they do not seek new words or
inspiration, nor do they want time to do other things,
nor change of any kind. We remember their mystery,
their faith and loyalty, their superb detachment, their
state of being enough unto themselves, their playfulness,
audacity, hospitality, how they shine compared
with Christians in the keeping of the conventions of
their religion, their punctual piety, their pilgrimages,
and, with all that, their fixed and definite inferiority
of caste.</p>

<p>Their pilgrimage to Mecca, which we are apt to
regard merely as something picturesque, is in reality
one of the most mysterious of human processions.
From Northern Africa, from Syria, from Turkey and
Armenia, from Turkestan, from the Chinese marches
(there are even Chinese Mohammedans, the Duncani),
from India, from the depths of Arabia and Persia&mdash;to
Mecca. Through Russia alone there travel annually
considerably more Moslems to Mecca than there do
Christian pilgrims to Jerusalem; and some of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
Mohammedan pilgrims are the most outlandish pilgrims.
They are illiterate, simple, unremarked. They
do not possess minds which could understand our
modern Christian missionaries, and Russia, at least, has
no desire to proselytise among them. If the peoples of
the world could be seen as part of a great design of
embroidery on the garment of God, it would probably
be seen that Mohammedanism at the present moment
is part of the beauty of the pattern and the amazing
labyrinthine scheme. It is not a rent, not a disfigurement.</p>

<p>Mahomet and the Mohammedans is not a subject to
dismiss, and when we look at those wondrous cities of
the East it is worth while remembering that we are
looking at a new image and superscription, and are in
the presence of people who own a different but none
the less true allegiance. As upon one of the planets
we might come across a different race that had not had,
and could not have, our revelation.</p>

<p>Our prejudice as militant Christians, however,
ought necessarily to be against Mohammedans. They
have ever been our religious enemies in arms, the
Saracens, the Paynim, the Tartar hordes; we are
not very amicably disposed to those of our argumentative
brothers who, to show their independence
of thought, say they prefer Mohammedanism or
Buddhism or Confucianism or what not.</p>

<p>In reading Carlyle&#8217;s &#8220;Heroes and Hero-worship&#8221;
there is a haunting feeling that it was a pity that
for the &#8220;Hero as Prophet&#8221; he chose Mahomet and
not Jesus, or that, choosing Mahomet, he had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
travelled in Mohammedan countries, investigating his
subject more thoroughly and giving a truer picture of
the significance of Mohammedanism and of the man
who founded it. The Mahomet section of &#8220;Heroes&#8221;
is like a note that does not sound. Heading the lecture
over again, one is struck with a new fact about Carlyle&mdash;his
insularity of intelligence. Despite the fact that
he is preoccupied with French and German history, you
notice his narrowness of vision, or perhaps it is that
the general vision of the world which men have now
was not so accessible in his day, and the differences in
national psychology now manifest were hidden in
obscurity then. Carlyle saw mankind as Scotsmen, and
all true religion whatsoever as a sort of Southern
Scottish Puritanism. He saw all national destinies in
one and the same type, without any conception of
fundamental differences of soul. He admired the
Germans, and the Germans adopted him and his
works. And he disliked the French because so few of
them had that &#8220;fixity of purpose&#8221; and &#8220;manliness,&#8221;
&#8220;thoroughness,&#8221; &#8220;grim earnestness&#8221; of his compatriots.
Russia was a very vague country, but Carlyle
approved of the Tsar, dimly discerning in him one who
must have something in common with Cromwell or
Frederick the Great, &#8220;keeping by the aid of Cossack
and cannon such a vast empire together.&#8221; And the
further his imagination ranges the more do his notions
of foreign peoples and races fail to correspond with
his patterns of humanity. Among the many other
destinies which Carlyle might have had and lived
through, one can imagine one wherein he travelled,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
and found in real life what he sought in museums and
libraries. He would have been a wonderful traveller,
and would have known and shown more of the verities
and mysteries of the world than he was able to do
through the medium of history.</p>

<p>Carlyle&#8217;s Mahomet is an example of old-fashioned
visions. It is clear now that this &#8220;deep-hearted Son of
the Wilderness, with his beaming black eyes and open
social deep soul,&#8221; was not that determined, conscientious
British sort of character that he is made out to
be, nor has Mohammedanism that Cromwellian earnestness
which Carlyle imputed to it.</p>

<p>It is impossible to find in the Moslem soul &#8220;the
infinite nature of duty,&#8221; but we would not explain the
&#8220;gross sensual paradise&#8221; and the &#8220;horrible flaming
hell&#8221; of the Mohammedans by saying that to them
&#8220;Right is to Wrong as life is to death, as heaven to
hell. The one must nowise be done, the other in nowise
be left undone.&#8221; Mahomet and Mohammedanism are
not explainable in these terms.</p>

<p>Probably the most common assumption in the West
is that Mohammedanism does not count. In its adherents
it greatly outnumbers Christianity, but not even
those who believe that the will of majorities should
prevail would recognise the Mohammedan majority.
For though more warlike than we, they have not our
weapons, and though they are finer physically, they
have not our helps to Nature, nor our civilisation, nor
our passion. They are apart, they are scarcely human
beings in our Western sense of the term, and are
negligible. Still, Mohammedanism is an extraordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
portent in the world. The Mohammedans, those many
millions, are not merely potential Christians, a set of
people remaining in error because our missionary enterprise
is not sufficient to bring them to the Light. It
is not an accident, or a makeshift religion, but evidently
a happy form suitable to the millions who embody it.
It is a poetically fitting religion, part of the very fibre
of the people who have it, and it cannot easily be got
rid of or supplanted.</p>

<p>As enthusiastic Christians we consider the Moslem
world with some vexation; some of us even with malice
and a readiness to take arms against it. But as pleasure-seeking
tourists and worldly men and women, we rather
love the Turk and the Arab for his &#8220;picturesqueness,&#8221;
for the picturesqueness of his religion. As sportsmen,
we love him because he has the reputation of fighting
well.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_040.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">MOHAMMEDAN TOMBS AND RUINS IN THE YOUNGEST OF THE RUSSIAN COLONIES</p>

<p>It was with a certain amount of dissatisfaction that
I fell into the hands of an Arab guide when I was in
Cairo, and was shown, first of all, the picturesque
mosques so beloved of tourists&mdash;the Mosque of Sultan
Hassan, the Alabaster Mosque, and so on. Not the
ancient Egyptian remains, which are the most significant
thing in Egypt; not the Early Christian ruins,
which are most dear to us (the old Christian monasteries
which the Copts possess seemed to be known by
none), but the mosques made of the stolen stones of
the Pyramids and of the tombs, and inlaid with the
jewels taken from ikon frames and rood-screens of the
first churches of Christianity. And as I listened to the
details of the blinding of the architects, the destruction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
of the Mamelukes, the fighting and the robbing, the
disparaging thought arose: &#8220;They are all a pack of
robbers, these Mohammedans.&#8221;</p>

<p>They are robbers by instinct, and non-progressive
not only in life, but in ideas. But they are picturesque,
and have given to a considerable portion of the earth&#8217;s
face a characteristic quaintness and beauty. They
cannot be dismissed.</p>

<p>Carlyle tries to see some light in the Koran, and
fails. Probably the Koran is translated in a wrong
spirit or to suit a British taste. But obviously it is
meant to be chanted, and it is full of rhythms with
which we are unfamiliar, as unfamiliar as we are with
the sobbing, plaintive, screaming music that is melody
in the Moslem&#8217;s ears. The soul of the Koran is not like
the soul of the Bible, just as the soul of a medi&aelig;val
Christian city such as Florence or Rome is unlike Khiva
or Bokhara or Samarkand, just as the souls of our eager
mystical populations are different from the souls of
those simple, satisfied and fatalistic people. It is not
easy to communicate the difference by words; it is not
merely a difference in clothes. It is a difference in the
spirit, a difference in the spirit that causes the expression
to be different, whether that expression be clothes,
or houses, or cities, or way of life, or music, or literature,
or prayer. And while our expression changes,
theirs remains the same. Our spirit remains the same,
theirs remains the same, but only with us does the
expression change.</p>

<p>&#8220;God is great; we must submit to God,&#8221; is
Mohammedan wisdom. It is in a way a common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
ground&mdash;we must submit. But with the Mohammedan
there is a waiting for God&#8217;s will to be shown, whereas
with us rather a divination of it in advance. We are
alive to find out what God wills for us. After &#8220;Thy
will be done!&#8221; we put an exclamation mark and rejoice.
Mohammedanism is fatalism, but Christianity is not
fatalism.</p>

<p>And if fatalism gives a tinge of melancholy to life,
especially to an unfortunate life, it still makes life
easier. It relieves the soul of care and takes a world of
responsibility off the shoulders. The Mohammedan is
a care-free being. He has, more than we have, the life
of a child.</p>

<p>Consequently, one of the greatest characteristics of
Mohammedan people is playfulness. All is play to
them. They are playful in their attire, in their
business, in their fighting, in their talking. They buy
and sell, and make a great game of their buying and
selling. They lack &#8220;seriousness.&#8221; They are in no
hurry to strike a bargain and get ahead in trade. Their
instinct is for the game rather than for the business.
Hence the comparative poverty of the Tartars&mdash;the
most commercial people of the East. They are not
serious enough to get rich in our Western way. If
they would get really rich as a Western merchant is
rich, they must not waste time playing and haggling.
They fight well because they see the game in fighting.
Death is not so great a calamity to them as to us, for
life is not such a serious thing. They look on playfully
at suffering, and laugh to see men&#8217;s limbs blown away
by bombs. They like the gamble of modern warfare.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
And, of course, they were warriors and robbers before
they were Mohammedans. Fighting is one of their
deepest instincts, and as they do not change with time
as we do, they have an almost anachronistic love of
battle. They are fond of weapons as of toys, fingering
blades and laughing, guffawing at the sight of cannon.
They love steamboats and battleships as children love
toy steamboats, and they sail them on the waters of the
Levant as children would their toys. Their hospitality
is mirthful, as are also their murders and their
massacres. Their heaven and hell are playful conceptions.</p>

<p>The condition of their remaining children is
obedience to the simple laws of their religion. These
obeyed, they are free of all troubles. And they obey.
Hence, from Delhi to Cairo and from Kashgar to Constantinople,
a playful and sometimes mischievous and
difficult world. Looking at the great cities, with their
quaint figures and their chaffering, their elfish spires
and minarets, their covered ways and gloomy and
mysterious passages; looking at this city of Bokhara,
with its covered ways crowded with these children-merchants
and children-purchasers, their beggars,
tombs, shrines, we must remember it is all a children&#8217;s
contrivance, something put together by a
people who do not grow up and do not grow serious
as we do&mdash;mysterious yet simple, fierce yet childlike,
valorous and yet amused by suffering, Islam, the
enemy of the Church in arms, to this day.</p>

<small>THE HISTORY OF THE TRIBES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FROM Bokhara I proceeded to Samarkand, the
grave of Timour. Turkestan has four great cities
remaining in splendour from the most remote times&mdash;Bokhara,
Khiva, Samarkand, and Tashkent. Alexander
the Great conquered most of this territory and established
himself at Samarkand for winter quarters, but
there are few traces of Alexander to-day. In his day
the land was inhabited by tribes who had come out of
the Pamir&mdash;Persians, Indians, Tadzhiks. There were
also primeval nomads, with their tents and their herds,
a people something like the Jews when they were simply
the Children of Israel, when they were a <i>family</i>. There
were possibly hordes of Jews, as there were hordes of
Tartars and Mongols. At the time of the shepherd
dynasty of Egypt the peoples of the East were living
in patriarchal families, resembling in a way the families
of the Kirghiz in Central Asia to-day.</p>

<p>For the ethnologist Central Asia is necessarily one
of the most interesting districts of the world, and its
inhabitants are like living specimens in a great ethnological
museum. The races there tell us more about
the past of the world in which we are interested than
any pages in the history book. Here we may feel what
the Children of Israel were, the Egyptians, the Syrians,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
the Persians, the Turks, the Russians. We see the
destiny of Rome, the destiny of the Church of Christ,
of Christianity, of barbarism.</p>

<p>Not that there are many pure or clear types of
historical races in Central Asia to-day. The land has
been a running ground for fierce tribes coming out of
China and Manchuria, coming from the mysterious and
vague regions of the Pamir and Thibet. The Kirghiz
to-day exhibit every shade of difference between the
Mongol and the Turk.</p>

<p>After the Greeks of Alexander came the first
ferocious Huns. To the Greeks what is now Russia
and Siberia, Seven Rivers Land and Russian Central
Asia was vaguely Scythia. They fumbled northward
and eastward as in a great darkness, and they were
rather afraid to go on. Yet we know that even before
the records of Greek history there was an Eastern trade
on the Volga and from the Caspian to the Baltic. The
merchants of Persia and India traded with the Russia
of those days. The Persians ruled from the Oxus to
the Danube, and in the wilderness stretching from the
Oxus to the Great Wall of China dwelt the primeval
nomads.</p>

<p>South of the Altai Mountains was the fount of the
mysterious Huns who, some centuries before the birth
of Christ, ravaged China to the Pacific and extended
their dominion northward, down the Irtish River to
the <i>tundra</i> of the Arctic Circle. These were not a
Mongol people, but Turkish, though eventually they
were beaten by the Tartars, and the Mongolian and
Turkish tended to blend. The reason for their turning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
westward was an eventual failure against China. The
Chinese built their fifteen-hundred-mile wall against
the Huns, but the wall did not avail them; they were
beaten, and were forced to pay an enormous tribute of
silk, gold, and women. Then the Chinese reorganised
their armies, turned upon their enemies, and crushed
them. Their monarch became a vassal of the Emperor.
Fifty-eight hordes entered the service of China&mdash;a
horde was about four thousand men. The remainder
of the Huns, coming to the conclusion that China
was too strong for them, resolved to fight somewhere
else, and set off westward towards the Oxus and
the Volga. They expended themselves on the eastern
shores of the Volga, where they remain to this day as
the Kalmeeks. Visitors to the Southern Ural and the
district of Astrakhan will have pointed out to them
the Kalmeeks, a low-browed, broad-nosed type of
men, sun-browned, wizened, and squat, the ugliest in
Russia; these are the original Huns, ferocious in their
day, very peaceful and stupid now, and below even
the level of the Kirghiz in intelligence.</p>

<p>The chief Turkish tribes to-day are the Yakuts, on
the Lena, the Kirghiz, the Uzbeks, of whom there
are a considerable number in Bokhara and Khiva, the
Turkomans, and Osmanli, the Turks themselves, and
they have all something of the Hun about them.
Their history is Hunnish history. A deformed and
brutal people were the hordes of the Huns; there
were many cripples among them and people of distorted
features, many dwarfs. They were the cruellest people
that have ever been, and probably that is why they have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
such a name for ugliness. Cruelty and ugliness of
feature go together. Even the most refined torturers
of the Spanish Inquisition must have been ugly. There
is something terrifying in the aspect of cruelty. It is
an aspect of mania, and when it comes out in the race
must be called racial mania or aberration.</p>

<p>Successive hordes of pagans rolled forward, and the
story of each forward movement of this kind is the same.
Each wave, however, seemed to roll farther than the
one before and gather in power and volume to the
point where it multitudinously broke. The Asiatic
heathen were soon over the Volga and across Russia;
it was they who set the North German tribes moving
and gave an impetus to the plundering and ransacking
of the Western world. They astonished even
the Goths by their ferocity and ugliness, and in
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 376 the Goths had to appeal to the Romans
for protection. The Emperor Valens delayed to
answer, and a million Goths crossed the Danube and
began the conquest of Roman territory. The Huns
joined with the Alani, a wild Finnish tribe supposed
by some to be the present Ossetini of the Northern
Caucasus, and together they obtained glimpses of the
splendour of the South and came into touch with the
people who would ultimately give them their religion&mdash;the
Saracens.</p>

<p>Away in the background of Central Asia, however,
Mongol tribes were falling on those Huns who had
remained behind and ever setting new hordes going
westward, and the impact from China was felt all
the way to Germany, and hordes of barbarians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
began to appear before the gates of Rome itself.
Soon the Goths burned the capital of the world
(<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 410). A quarter of a century later the Huns
found a new leader in Attila (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 438-453), and
became once more the scourge and terror of all
existent civilisation. The Huns of Attila were not
just the old Huns who came out of Mongolia and
fought with the Chinese, but a mixture of all the
Turkish tribes of the East. They worshipped the
sword, stuck in the ground, and prayed before it as
others prayed before the Cross. Attila claimed to have
discovered the actual sword of the God Mars, and
through the possession claimed dominion over the whole
world. He conquered Russia and Germany, Denmark,
Scandinavia, the islands of the Baltic. He crushed the
Chinese and Tartars who were afflicting the rearguard
of his nation in the depths of Asia, negotiating on equal
terms with the Emperor of China. He traversed Persia
and Armenia and what is now Turkey in Asia, broke
through to Syria, and, in alliance with the Vandals,
took possession of &#8220;Africa.&#8221; His followers crossed the
Mediterranean, devastating the cities of Greece, Italy,
and Gaul. Rome abandoned her Eastern Empire to
the Huns in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 446; and, after Attila&#8217;s death, the
Vandals, a people of Slavonic origin, sacked Rome once
more. Western civilisation seemed to be extinguished,
and a barbarian became King of Italy.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_048.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">A MOHAMMEDAN FESTIVAL AT SAMARKAND&mdash;THE HOUR OF PRAYER</p>

<p>What was happening in Central Asia is but
vaguely known. The people who lived on the horse
at the time of Herodotus still lived on the horse as
they do at this day, on mare&#8217;s milk, koumis, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
horseflesh, camping amidst great herds of horses, the
same breed as the Siberian ponies which the Cossacks
ride now. There were feuds of the hordes, raids,
massacres; the Chinese are said to have attempted to
introduce Buddhism, though without much success.
There was much intermarriage of Turks and Mongols.
On the other hand, the conquering Huns returned
with wives of the races of the West, and with a
smattering of Western ideas, bringing even with them
the name of Christianity, and some Christian ideas.
Christians began to appear in the ranks of the
pagans.</p>

<p>In the seventh century Mahomet was born, and
the characteristic religion of the East took its start,
and was soon conquering adherents by the sword;
armies of Arabs and Semitic tribes, initiating the
propaganda of Islam, conquered Persia, Syria, and
portions of Northern Africa and of Spain. In the
eighth century they crossed the Oxus, drove hordes
of Huns back into the depths of Asia, captured the
rich cities of Bokhara and Samarkand, and made
Mohammedans of all the people all the way to the
Indus. So Uzbeks and Turkomans and Kirghiz and
Afghans and the others obtained a religion which
suited their temperament, and there was comparative
peace and trade throughout all Turkestan and Persia
for many a long year. The next great disturbance
was caused by the ferment of the Tartars and the
mongrel Mongolian Huns, which came to a head
under the leadership of Chingiz Khan (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1206-1227),
who was the next conqueror of the world springing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
out of Asia. He made for himself an enormous
empire, extending from the Sea of Japan to the River
Nieman in Germany, and from the <i>tundras</i> of the Arctic
Circle to the wastes of India and Mesopotamia. There
were in his army idolaters and Judaic, Mohammedan,
and Christian converts. He was the Emperor of the
&#8220;Moguls&#8221;&mdash;the word Mogul is the same as Mongol.
Among his feats he laid siege to Pekin, and starved the
Chinese to such a point that they were forced to kill
and eat every tenth man within the city. He conquered
Bokhara and Samarkand again, crushed the Russians
and the Poles, took Liublin and Cracow, and, at the
battle of Lignitz, defeated the Germans, filling nine
sacks with the right ears of the slain. Because of
Chingiz Khan all Western Europe trembled.</p>

<p>The manners of the hordes of Chingiz Khan and
his successors were very like the manners of the old
Huns, and they also brought their flocks with them,
and lived on roast sheep and roast horse and koumis
as the majority of the dwellers of Central Asia seem
to have ever lived.</p>

<p>The splendour of the successors of Chingiz Khan
decayed, and Russia and the East gasped and waited
till Asia produced another monster&mdash;a new conqueror
of the world. In the fourteenth century he arose, the
worst of all, Tamerlane the Great, called Timour the
Lame, who conquered everything that had ever been
conquered before by Tartar or Hun. Under him
Mohammedanism reached a great splendour and came
nearest to world-domination.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_050.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">CENTRAL ASIAN JEWESSES</p>

<p>Both Bokhara and Samarkand fell to Tamerlane.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
He conquered great stretches of Persia, Syria, Turkey,
the Caucasus, India, Russia and Siberia, besieged
Moscow and Delhi in two successive years, dethroned
twenty-seven kings, harnessed kings to his chariot
instead of horses.</p>

<p>I spent the May of this year in what is particularly
the land of Tamerlane, a sort of Russian
India on the northern side of Hindu Kush, a country
with a majestic past but with little present. Tamerlane
the Tartar was once Emperor of Asia, and a
potentate of greater fame than Alexander. At the
head of the Tartar hordes he conquered all the nations
of the East and ravaged every land, committing everywhere
deeds of splendour and of barbaric cruelty. The
cruelty that is in the Cossack and the Russian, and the
taste for barbaric splendour, comes directly from his
Tartars. But the greatness of the Tartars has passed
away&mdash;they are all tradesmen and waiters to-day&mdash;and
the greatness of the Russians has come about&mdash;they are
all soldiers. &#8220;Is it not touching?&#8221; said a Russian to
me one day at dinner in a Petersburg restaurant,
pointing at the perfect Tartar waiters. &#8220;These people
under whose yoke we were are really stronger and
more terrible than we are, but they are now our
servants, waiters, valets. If we had become Mohammedans,
the Tartars would still be greater than we.
It is the Christian idea that has triumphed in us.&#8221;</p>

<p>There stand among the deserts of Turkestan and
beside the irrigated cotton fields of a new civilisation,
the remains and ruins of a medi&aelig;val glory, the
mosques and tombs and palaces of the days of Timour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
and of his loved wife, Bibi Khanum. The Russians are
not touched by arch&aelig;ology, and have no interest in
pagans, even splendid pagans. English people have
considerable difficulty in obtaining permission to enter
the country. So Tamerlane is little thought of. But
in England, in the fifteenth and fourteenth centuries,
he had a tremendous fame&mdash;you feel that fame in
Marlowe&#8217;s great drama:</p>

<p>England&#8217;s opinion was the same as Pistol&#8217;s, and
the grandeur of Tamerlane was forgotten. Yet in
two successive years he conquered India and Eastern
Russia. He wore what was traditionally held to be
the armour of King David. And, to-day, who so
poor as to do him reverence? Only the beautiful
name of Timour and the ruins of his tombs and
mosques remain, giving a strange atmosphere of
mystery and melancholy to the youngest of Russian
colonies.</p>

<p>It is possible now to linger in the romantic idea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
of all the splendour that has passed away, and to feel
a strange beauty in Samarkand. I remember reading
some years ago a beautiful prose poem in modern
&#8220;impressionist&#8221; style, written by Zoe Pavlovska,
who is, I suppose, a Russian&mdash;perhaps a Cossack. It
was the story of pilgrimage to the tomb of Tamerlane&#8217;s
most loved princess:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I shall go to the tomb of the Emperor&#8217;s daughter. It
will be night, but a night when the moon is full; its clear
light will guide me through the mazes of the streets of the
city. These will be narrow. At dark corners I shall be
afraid&mdash;muffled forms will glide past me in the deep shadows
of the walls.</p>

<p>Now and then a light will shine from some open window.
I shall stop and hear the chanting of poems, and will wait
to listen, swaying in time with the rhythm.</p>

<p>I shall hear&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who will converse with me now that the yellow camels
are gone? There is no friend for the stranger, save the
stranger.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then I shall creep out of the town by a turquoise-tiled
gate. There they will ask me, &#8220;Where do you go?&#8221; I
shall answer, showing them my box of jade, &#8220;I go to the
tomb of Bibi Khanum, to lay this at her feet.&#8221; I will
then show them the flower in my box.</p>

<p>When I have reached the place I shall stand below the
broken arches, and will see that they are bluer than the
blue night sky beyond them; the moon will make strange
shadows. It will seem as if giant warriors are guarding
her. Coming to the place where her body lies I shall say,
&#8220;O beloved of Timour&#8221;&mdash;he who sleeps under a deep
green sea of jade&mdash;&#8220;I have brought for you a flower.&#8221;
Then, though in a cloudless sky, the moon will slowly hide
herself, the purple shadows will lengthen till all is black
save where she lies; there each jewel on her tomb will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
glow into its own colour, as if lighted from within, and by
this faint light I shall see the pale hands and faces of four
Tartar warriors who will lift the stone which covers her.
As they put it on the ground they will once more become
one with the darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brothers, I am afraid; stay near me.&#8221; Thus shall I
cry to them. There will be no answer, only a silence made
more desolate by the continuous throbbing round of a distant
drum. Slowly from the mingled light of the jewels
a form will rise in garments of the colour of ripe pomegranates
worked with flowers in gold; some apple-green
ribbons will fall from her shoulder, and under her breasts
will be a sash of vivid crimson. She will wear on her head
a crown of jewels and flowers and dull gold leaves; jade
and amethyst drops will fall from this crown on either side
of her face, which will be painted tulip-pink and her lips
scarlet; her eyes will be rimmed with black jewels ground
into powder.</p>

<p>Then, gazing at her, I shall lay at her feet the flower
from my garden, and, smiling, she will give me an amber
poppy. She will say, looking into my eyes, &#8220;You ask
for sleep&mdash;I would give my eternity of slumber for one
moment of that sorrow I called life.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>The Great War of to-day makes the past more
melancholy, and, as the centuries roll out with
ever newer sorrows and calamities and strifes, the
faces in history seem paler, sadder. The twilight of
oblivion deepens. The history of man becomes more
melancholy.</p>

<small>TO TASHKENT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE country east of Samarkand is much greener
than the country west of it. It was interesting
to note that the farther east I went from the shores
of the Caspian the less did the desert predominate.
There was abundant life on the plains; many horses
grazing, many camels carrying grey marble for
the building of new palaces, many sheep. At the
railway stations were Sarts, Kirghiz, Afghans, occasional
Hindus, Jews&mdash;not Russian Jews, but polygamous
Eastern Jews, a rich, secluded, conservative
tribe, who will not own their Russian brethren or sit
down with them at meat&mdash;at least, so a Jew in the
train informed me.</p>

<p>Samarkand is outside the protectorate of Bokhara,
and takes its stand now as a city of the Russian
Empire. It is also a great Mohammedan centre, as
much by tradition and history as by present fact; but
it is now completely under Russian influence, and the
future which it has is one which will show itself more
and more purely Russian. Already there are 25,000
Russians there. The city is divided by one long
boulevard into two parts, native and Russian, and it
may be surmised that the present state of Samarkand
foreshadows the future state of Bokhara, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
those three or four houses which form the Russian
part of Bokhara will at length find themselves the
centre of a great Russian city, standing face to face
with the Eastern and ancient town. What a history
has Samarkand, both in legend and in history! It
was founded by a fabulous person in 4000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, but
only emerged into history as a place conquered by
Alexander of Macedon. It was successively conquered
by the various monarchs of the Huns and the Tartars
and by proselytising Arabs and by the Uzbeks, and
at last by the Russians in 1868. Its whole history is
one of being conquered. Its people to-day are the
most gentle in the world, wear no weapons, commit
no violence, never even seem to get angry&mdash;I refer,
of course, to the native Sarts.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_056.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">FINE-LOOKING SARTS IN OLD TASHKENT</p>

<p>A fine chain of cities&mdash;Askhabad, Merv, Bokhara,
Samarkand, Tashkent&mdash;and strange to realise them to
be all on the railway and in direct economic communication
with Europe; it is possible to take a train
from Petersburg to Tashkent, or to Bokhara, or to
the Persian frontier without change. During the
week in which I was at Bokhara and Samarkand work
was begun on the new railway which is to run from
Tashkent to Kuldzha, in Chinese Tartary, and in a
little while, perhaps, we may see an agreement made
and work begun in the construction of the railway to
India through Persia. Russia, stopped in the Far East
by the emergence of modern Japan, and thwarted in
the Balkans, seemed in the time just before the
Great War to be concentrating her attention on what
may be called the Middle East. How open Europe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
is becoming to the East, and how easy of access is
the East becoming to us! The friendship of English
and Russians in Central Asia must mean a larger,
stronger life for both Empires. And the development
of Asia can mean much to the home Russians; they,
as we, are inclined to take their own land and their
capital cities as the only places of interest in the
world. Already, reading some of the Moscow and
Petersburg newspapers, you may alter Kipling&#8217;s
phrase and ask: &#8220;What do they know of Russia
who only Moscow know?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tashkent is the capital of Russian Central Asia,
and is a well-built city extending over an enormous
area. It occupies a space something like a fifth of
that which London occupies. There is no crowding
anywhere. The houses, for fear of earthquakes, have
in no case more than two storeys, and seldom that.
There are many public gardens, where you may sit
at white-spread tables and drink <i>narzan</i> or koumis in
the dense shade of thickly foliaged trees. Tashkent
is a city on an oasis. It has wonderful vegetation.
Along all the streets run brisk streams of fresh water,
conducted on the irrigation system from the river.
There is a noise all day and all night of running
water, so that if you wake in the hush of night and
listen to it, you may imagine for a moment that you
are living in a village among hills aleak with thousands
of cascades and rivulets. How useful is this water-supply
to Tashkent! There is no need for water-carts;
strong natives are employed with buckets to
scoop water from the streams and fling it across the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
cobbles all day. So effectual is their work that there
is never a whiff of dust, and, indeed, it is occasionally
necessary to wear galoshes, the streets having been
made so muddy. The streams freshen the air, keep
down the dust, give life to the lofty poplars of the
many avenues, and they are the convenient element
for thousands of Mohammedans to wash in before
saying their prayers. The streams make the town
into the country. As you walk down the pavemented
High Street, and look in at the truly fine shops of
Tashkent, your attention may still be diverted by the
dainty water wagtail that is nesting near by, and as
you wait for the electric tram you observe the small
heath butterfly flitting along, as much at home as
upon the mountains. At night, whilst all the Russians,
in white clothes, parade up and down and gossip, and
the moon looks down from above the gigantic trees of
the gardens and the main streets, the streams still
take attention, for there proceeds from them a tumultuous,
everlasting, raging chorus of frog-calling.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_058.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">OUTSIDE A GERMAN SHOP IN OLD TASHKENT</p>

<p>Up the many long streets from the old town
to the new come strings of gentle-looking camels&mdash;low-backed,
single-humped, long-necked camels, with
sometimes as many as twenty necklaces of blue beads
from below their ears. The horses, too, are much
adorned with carpet cloths and coloured strings that
keep the flies away. The high-wheeled carts of Bokhara
have become too common in Tashkent to attract attention.
Altogether, indeed, the Orient strikes one
less romantically here than in Bokhara. The native
population of 200,000 is very dirty and disorderly; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
women, behind their veils, not nearly so strict or so
careful; the houses not so well kept&mdash;all in dirt and
ruin. On the roofs of the mosques are thousands of
red poppies in bloom, and occasionally the crane&#8217;s
nest is to be seen on the tops of the towers whence
the muezzin calls to prayer. There are booths of
coppersmiths and carpet-makers and silk-workers, and
caravanserai where all manner of picturesque Moslems
are to be seen lying on divans and carpets or squatting
over basins of tea; but all is second-hand and
down-at-heel after Bokhara. With the coming of the
Russians the angel of death has breathed on all that
was once the grandeur of the Orient at Tashkent.
Once there were no Russians in the land, and then
what is now old Tashkent was the only Tashkent; it
was a great Moslem city that could be pointed to
geographically as such. But as the fine Russian
streets were laid down, and the large shops opened,
and the cathedrals were built, and the gardens laid
out, the old uphill-and-down-dale labyrinth of the
Eastern city slowly changed to a curiosity and an
anachronism. It faded before the eyes. The next
year the Russians were to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary
of the conquest of the town&mdash;only the fiftieth!
Poor old Tashkent, slipping into the sere and yellow
leaf, passing away even as one looked, always decreasing
whilst the new town is always increasing&mdash;there
is much pathos in its destiny.</p>

<p>The natives are mostly Sarts, an absolutely
unambitious people, honest, quiet, sober. Scarcely
any crime ever takes place among them. A week<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
in the year they are said to go off on a spree and get
rid of the sin in them. For the rest of the time
they are like lambs. They are uninterested in everything
except small deals in the wares they make or
sell. Their wives have rings in their nostrils for
adornment&mdash;so I observed when the sun shone brightly
on their black veils. A strange sight the electric
tram which goes from the old town to the new and
back again&mdash;crowded with men in white turbans and
long robes and with Eastern women in their veils.</p>

<p>The foundation of the society of new Tashkent is
laid by the regiments quartered there, and the fine
shops exist chiefly for the custom of officers and their
wives. A Grand Duke, who was banished for giving
a Crown jewel to a favourite lady, lives here in
exile, but he is an aged man now and receives few
guests. High official personages constantly visit the
colony, and consequently stay at Tashkent. The
whole atmosphere is military, and there is an unusual
smartness everywhere. Especially do you notice how
well dressed the women are at the theatres and in
the gardens, and the men accompanying them nearly
all wear the sword. The middle-class Russian is out
of sight, and the peasant labourer is rare, owing to
the fact that the Sarts work at 9d. a day, but the
Russian at 1s. or 1s. 3d. There is, however, a dandy
Armenian element; young hawkers and shoeblacks
and barbers who appear in the evening in white
collars and cheap serges, with combed locks under
felt hats, with canes in their hands.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_060.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">TASHKENT: A FOOTBALL MATCH AT THE COLLEGE</p>

<p>Tashkent has now many schools, from the important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
Corpus, the military college where officers&#8217; sons
are educated, to the little native school where the
Russian schoolmaster tries to give Russian to the Sart.
I visited the splendid military school, and was only
sorry to be too late in the season to see an hour of
Russian football, the game being very popular with
the boys. Most of the professors at this school are
officers, and I met a charming staff-captain who had
known several English correspondents during the war
in Manchuria. The teacher of French gave me some
interesting photographs.</p>

<p>There are six cinema shows at Tashkent, two
theatres, an open-air theatre, a skating rink, and many
small diversions. The native turns up in the cinema,
and there are generally long lines of turbaned figures
in the front of the theatre. At the real theatres it is
necessarily those who know Russian who take the seats.
At the open-air theatre they play <i>The Taming of the
Shrew</i>, at the Coliseum the <i>Doll&#8217;s House</i> and Artsibasheff&#8217;s
<i>Jealousy</i>. The town has two newspapers,
and on the day on which I arrived I found that the
leading article of the <i>Courier of Turkestan</i> was entitled
&#8220;The State of Affairs in Ulster.&#8221; All Europe seemed
to have its eyes on our politics, and Europe extends
now as far east as Tashkent, though it is of &#8220;Central
Asia&#8221; that that city claims to be the capital.</p>

<p>A wonderful place Tashkent. Cherries ripen there
by the 1st of May, strawberries are seven copecks a
pound in mid-May. Everything ripens three weeks
earlier than in Russia proper. It is a fresh, fragrant
city&mdash;an interesting curiosity among the cities of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
world. The Russians have in it a city worth possessing.
It must be said they have done their best to
possess it, not merely in the letter of the law, but
by improving it and governing it and giving it a
Russian atmosphere. Despite camels and mosques,
and natives in their turbans, and the sad call of the
muezzin, you feel all the time as you go up and
down the streets of Tashkent that you are in Russia.</p>

<p>The Kaufmann Square is, I suppose, the noblest
position in the new city, all the avenues and prospects
being used to frame the monument which
stands there. This is the statue of General Kaufmann,
who took possession of the land for the
Russians. On one side of the monument is a fierce,
dark, enormous, two-headed eagle in stone. But
between its claws this year a dove had its nest.
From behind the eagle General von Kaufmann stands
and looks over his new-conquered country. On the
other side of the monument there is the following
inscription:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;I pray you bury me here that everyone may know that
here is true Russian earth in which no Russian need be
ashamed to lie.&#8221;</p>

<p class="right">(<i>From a letter of</i> <span class="smcap">General Kaufmann</span>, 1878.)</p>

Russian with a German name.</p>

<small>THE RUSSIAN CONQUEST</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Russian princes, Yaroslaf Vsevolodovitch
and his son, Alexander Nevsky, did homage to
the Mongol khans in the thirteenth century. Timour
brought back thousands of Russian slaves after his
conquests, and Russia lay under the yoke of the
Tartars. The Empire of Asia lasted only a little
while in the hands of the dynasty of Tamerlane, and
the Uzbek and the Kirghiz Cossacks appeared, waging
a holy war for Islam. At the present moment there
are one million Uzbeks in the province of Bokhara,
three hundred and fifty thousand in Khiva, and five
hundred thousand spread over the rest of Russian
Turkestan, and a sprinkling in Afghanistan. The
Uzbeks formed three kingdoms, Bokhara, Khiva, and
Kokand. The Emirs of these states are to this day
Uzbeks, but are now little more than Russian civil
servants. A dependence of Kokand was Pamir, where
the Karakirghiz wandered with their flocks&mdash;people
now wandering on the Thian Shan mountains in
Ferghan and Seven Rivers Land, also in parts of
Sirdaria and Eastern Turkestan. The Kirghiz Cossacks
came south from what is now the Akmolinsk
Steppe in Siberia. This race, a sort of mongrelisation
of Huns and Tartars, diffused itself over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
whole desert from Lake Balkhash to the Ural. In
the seventeenth century they were an organised and
powerful nation, with a Khan at Tashkent; but in
the succeeding century there was faction and dissension,
and the nation divided off into three large
hordes. The great horde went to Seven Rivers Land
in the Northern Ural, the middle horde to the
Steppes of Akmolinsk, and the little horde to Sirdaria
and the Ural. From that day their military
spirit seems to have steadily waned. To-day they are
as peaceful as their herds. During the years 1846 to
1854, the Russians began to penetrate the deserts of
Seven Rivers Land and take the Kirghiz over as
subjects. There was very little actual fighting till
the Russians came into contact with the Uzbeks of
Kokand, whom, however, they fought and overthrew
with considerable slaughter. Vemey fell in 1854, Pishpek
and Tokmak in 1862. Then the Russians turned
westward, and took Aulie Ata, Chimkent, and Tashkent.
In 1867 Seven Rivers Land was made into a
Russian province, and the stream of Russian colonisation
turned out of Siberia southward toward India.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_064.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">PLEASANT COUNTRY OUTSIDE TASHKENT</p>

<p>One stream of colonists was moving southward
from Siberia, another was moving eastward from the
Volga. One observes the rise of the Russian power.
In the sixteenth century the Russian had begun to
take the upper hand, and Kazan and Astrakhan,
though predominantly Tartar cities, fell to the
assaults of Christian arms. In the eighteenth century
the peasant colonists had already come into contact
with the Kirghiz Cossacks, and boundary lines had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
to be drawn. Orenburg fell into Russian hands in
1748, and peaceful penetration followed military
success. In 1847 the great horde of the Kirghiz
became Russian subjects, and all the races of Central
Asia began to talk about the coming advance of the
Russians and the need to fight them. The Russian
war of conquest was consummated in the East.
From Tashkent the Russians proceeded to make war
on the Bokharese. In vain did the Emir of Bokhara
demand the evacuation of Tashkent by the Russians.
In 1866 the Bokharese were defeated at the battle of
Irdzhar, and Khodzkent was taken by storm. After
heavy fighting with Uzbeks and Turkomans and great
slaughter of the Mohammedans, they approached
Samarkand, which at last they occupied at the invitation
of the inhabitants. In 1868 a treaty was made
between the Emir of Bokhara and the Tsar, whereby
Samarkand and district passed to Russia.</p>

<p>In 1869 a Russian army crossed the Caspian and
laid siege to Krasnovodsk, and attempts were made
to push across the desert along the northern frontier
of Persia. The Turkomans, however, offered an heroic
resistance, and it was not until 1880, when Skobelef
was given charge of the task of subduing the tribes,
that Russia made progress. At the beginning of
December, 1880, the army of Turkestan, under
Colonel Kuropatkin, made over five hundred miles
progress across the flying sands and took the fortress
of Dengil-Tepe. Askhabad was taken, and all the
fortified points in Transcaspia. Transcaspia was made
into a Russian province in 1881.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>In 1884 there was a short struggle, and then
the ancient city of Merv fell into Russian hands,
and the English began to view the Russian progress
with uneasiness. There was even such a word coined
as &#8220;mervousness,&#8221; and Russophobes had Merv on the
brain. It must be admitted we were rather backward
not to treat with the Russians and obtain definite
trade treaties at that time. For we lost and Germany
gained a great deal of trade which we might
still have retained.</p>

<p>Bokhara and Khiva came under Russian protection.
The Central Asian Railway was built, and
Russia became the most important Power in the
Moslem world of Central Asia, owning as subjects so
many millions of Kirghiz, Sarts, Uzbeks, Turkomans,
Tekintsi, Tartars, and being neighbours of Turks,
Persians, Afghans and what not. Never was such a
stretch of territory, so many new subjects, or so
much trade and interest won with so little trouble.
It was won almost by military processions. It must
be remembered that it could not have been held, nor
would Russia have any real footing there to-day, but
for the peasant pioneers who followed the armies and
began settling the land. And the peasants would
not have remained if the Government of Russia
had not helped them with loans, found them
suitable plots for their villages, and irrigated the
desert.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_066.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">HEARTY SHEPHERDS: ALL KIRGHIZ</p>

<p>Now Turkestan and Russian Central Asia are
extremely loyal, peaceful and happy Russian colonies.
Rebellion was put down with such severity by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
Russians, the defeats were with such slaughter, that
the Asiatic tribesmen learned that Russia was too
powerful to be trifled with; they knew they had
found their masters, and submitted absolutely. The
Russians overcowed their spirits, they felt there was
some magic power behind them, and that human
resistance was vain. Then fear gave way to placid
acceptance of mastery, and the Russians began building
churches and schools and fortresses and barracks,
shops, towns, villages, and no one said them nay.
Trade passed into the hands of Russian merchants,
and new towns sprang up beside the old ones&mdash;new
Bokhara beside old Bokhara, new Tashkent beside old
Tashkent, and the Moslems saw unveiled the will of
God. They could not have been a very warlike
people really. They are not like the Mohammedans
under our rule or the Turks, though it is quite possible
that if, as a result of this war, a great quantity of
Armenia and Turkey fell into Russian hands, the
Mohammedans there would accept their fate as destiny
and settle down to live as peacefully as their fellow-believers
of Russian Central Asia. These are meek.
During the past winter the Germans have been
endeavouring to stir up Islam to fight England,
France and Russia. Germany and Turkey have found
a common ground. The Arabs in Mesopotamia are
fighting a holy war against us. Persia has wavered;
there has been ferment in India, there might have
been a rising in Afghanistan, but there has been no
chance of a rising of those Mohammedans who are
Russian subjects. All the aborigines of Russian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
Central Asia are devoted to peace, and none have
any quarrel with the Russian Empire.</p>

<p>Russia, of course, has considerable control over
her Mohammedan subjects because of the railways.
The development of the lines in Central Asia has
undoubtedly been a wise Imperial measure on Russia&#8217;s
part, and they are the best fruits of her conquest. The
construction afforded certain interesting engineering
problems, though it may be remarked that Russian
engineers generally succeed in building railways over
plains, even over deserts, but fail when they come to
mountains.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_068.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">THE RUSSIAN TEACHER: A NATIVE SCHOOL IN TASHKENT</p>

<p>The Central Asian Railway had for its original
object the pacification of the Tekintsi, and was a
strategic line from the Transcaspian post of Krasnovodsk
to the oasis of Kizil Arvat. It was built
over the desert, and was at first regarded as of a
temporary military character. It cannot now be
regarded as a well-built railway, is very loose, and
trains are forced to go very slowly, and it is constantly
in danger of sand obstruction through storms.
In the progress of the military operations against the
Tekintsi, Geok-Tepe was stormed in January, 1881,
and the first train went through to Kizil Arvat in
December of the same year. Kizil Arvat remained
the terminus until the fray with the Afghans, on
March 30th, 1885, when the prolongation was undertaken
seriously. In June, 1885, the Tsar decided
to continue the railway towards the frontier of
Afghanistan, and by December 11th, 1885, the
Russian military railway gangs had taken the rails<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
136 miles on to Askhabad, at the northern limit of
Persia. Merv was annexed, the rails went on to
Merv. By December, 1886, the railway had gone
on to Chardzhui, on the Oxus. The red river was
bridged, and the railway went on to Bokhara and
Samarkand. A state service of steamers was started
on the Oxus between Chardzhui and Khiva. In
1888 the completion of the line to Samarkand was
celebrated, and the railway was consecrated with
ecclesiastical pomp. The Russians have always given
the impression that they did not intend to develop
their railways, and yet they have gone on developing
them all the same. They have gone south from Merv
to the River Kush, on the Afghanistan frontier, and
east from Khodgent to Andigan and Kokand. They
have brought a main line from Petrograd, by way of
Orenburg, over the deserts of Sirdaria, to the cities
of Turkestan and Tashkent, and have thus a railway
all the way from the Baltic to within a few hundred
miles of India. In February, 1916, trains were first
run on the first reach of the new railway that is to
join Russia and Western China. It is now possible
to go to Chimkent by train, and possibly next year
to Aulie Ata. If English were in charge of this
territory there would probably be more railways by
now. In any case, the chief value of the railways has
been the means they afforded of bloodless pacification
of tribes. But their future is not so much a military
future as one of trade and Imperial development.</p>

<p>Russia has made her Imperial conquests by force
of arms, and safeguarded them by railways and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
colonisation. It should be remembered that before and
after and all the time runs the natural stream of
colonisation. The ultimate bond of unity is that
which comes from the national family ties of colonisation.
Nothing stands in Russia&#8217;s way, and she is
always quietly colonising the empty East.</p>

<p>An interesting yearly chart might be issued by
the Russian Government showing the waves of
colonisation: the new spots in forests and deserts
that have been given names, the new farms, the
thickening of the population in the nearer-in districts,
the efflorescence of Russian enterprise at the
farthest-out points whither they have gone. Several
hundred Russian families are settled in Northern
Persia, several hundred also in Mongolia and China.
The movement goes on, and it is not primarily due
to the density of population in European Russia.
All Russia, excepting the few industrial regions, is
under rather than over-populated. There is plenty of
room. Why, then, should Russia increase? or why
not? Russia has access to the empty heart of Asia.
The old world is hollow at the core, and Russia has
access to that great, wide hollowness, stands at the
door of it and stares into the great emptiness. Then
her people are wanderers; they have the wandering
spirit. A cross wind blows over them, and they are
gipsies&mdash;the roving heart rules the mind. They love
the road and the quest. They are seekers. Even
the most materialistic of them, the least religious in
their outward expression, nourish dreams of success
and ideas of golden climes to be found &#8220;beyond the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
horizon.&#8221; We should call many of them ne&#8217;er-do-wells,
though as a matter of fact they are all intent
to do well somewhere. They take up farms and give
up farms with too little scruple, and then go farther,
disgusting the official eye in one district, but knowing
they will delight other official eyes farther on
when they turn up with carts and cattle and belongings
at some verdant, empty wilderness still farther
away from the centre of Russia.</p>

<small>ON THE ROAD</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE was some difficulty in getting on from
Tashkent. I had two British notes, but no
bank would change them. The clerks held the paper
upside down, took it to their colleagues, who were
supping tea whilst they worked at their ledgers, took
it to the manager to show him a curiosity, and finally
returned it to me &#8220;with much regret.&#8221; &#8220;Don&#8217;t
think we are savages,&#8221; said one bank clerk, &#8220;because
we do not accept your money. The fact is, we&#8217;ve
never seen it before and cannot even read what is
written on it.&#8221; Another clerk, a sympathiser,
advised me that there was an Englishman in Tashkent,
a merchant who did much business and had an
account in the bank, bade me go to him, for he
would know what the notes were worth, and
would no doubt accommodate a fellow-countryman.
I obtained the address and sought out my compatriot.
His name was something like Kellerman&mdash;not
very promising. Behold one of the funniest
Englishmen I ever met&mdash;as clear a German Jew as
I&#8217;d ever seen in my life, scarcely speaking English,
and making all the comic mistakes which Germans
make with our tongue, a fat, ill-shaven, collarless
old man of a greasy complexion, a middleman buying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
wool and horsehair and oilcakes and seed from the
native Sarts and Jews and Tartars and Kirghiz. He
professed to be very pleased to meet a fellow-countryman,
and to be yearning for his &#8220;native
land&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;a nice house in Kentish Town, all fog and
wet in the streets, a nice fire, pull the blinds down,
and read the &#8216;<i>Daily Telegraaf</i>.&#8217;&#8221; Every night in
Tashkent he repaired to the public gardens, took a
seat beside the skating rink, and watched the violent
whirl of Armenian youths and their lady friends on
roller-skates. Each night between ten and twelve
Kellerman might be found in his place, chuckling
to himself at the sight of accidents. &#8220;Causts
nawthing,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and it&#8217;s such a pleasure to
see other people break their necks or their legs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Needless to say, he would not touch my notes;
at first thought they might be false, and then offered
me three pounds ten each for them. He said he
wouldn&#8217;t change them, but would be willing to make
a deal and treat it as a matter of business. So I had
to post my money to Moscow.</p>

<p>The next obstruction was from the police, who
doubted whether I had permission to wander about
in Central Asia, and it was only after I had myself
looked through the books at the police-station that I
found my name, almost unrecognisably spelt, in
the list of those who had permission. At last I
got both my money in Russian change and my
<i>vis&eacute;</i>, and was free to go. So I started my long
journey from the limits of the railway to the frontier
of China.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>I took train to Kabul Sai, a little station north
of Tashkent, and thence set out across the grass-covered
downs to Chimkent, the first point of
importance on my journey. I was a little anxious
lest I should be stopped by the station gendarme,
for it was not to be thought that every local police
authority would have my name legibly inscribed, and
I did not want to be delayed waiting while Kabul
Sai and a hundred other places wrote to Tashkent
for information. However, I escaped attention, and,
having made a good country dinner (big dinner, I
should rather say) at the station buffet, I lounged
about till the train went out of the station, and then,
considering compass and map, I cut across country
and found the road&mdash;without questions.</p>

<p>So I got on to my feet in Sirdaria, the land of
the little horde of the Kirghiz. The plain was dusty
and vast, with a great sky overhead. There were
long-legged beetles that scampered through the dust
of the road, tortoises and their families eating grass
and dandelions, and very much taken aback when
picked up and examined. Father Tortoise is big and
green; his children are wee, like young crabs. There
was no cultivation anywhere in sight; the first grass
had already seeded and withered, but thousands of
blue irises were in blossom, and the tall sheaves of
their leaves contrasted strangely with the dying grass
below. The sun was hot, but a fresh, travelling
wind fairly lifted me as I walked. A chorus of larks
overhead made the prelude to my journey.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_074.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">A KIRGHIZ GRANDMOTHER: VENDOR OF <i>KOUMIS</i></p>

<p>The only people on the road were Kirghiz. Far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
away on the hills I noticed their great flocks of cattle
and the circular tents of the nomads. There were no
villages. No villages, because it was hardly &#8220;white
man&#8217;s country&#8221;; there was no water to drink. I
thought to make myself tea, but I reckoned without
my host. Where there should have been streams
there was only a broken parquet of dry mud. No
trees, no shade, no shelter, and, if I should find water,
no fuel. The five post-wagons, drawn each by three
horses and driven by enormously fat Kirghiz drivers
with faces the colour of dull mahogany, went past me
in a cloud of dust, and I watched them away as the
sun was setting. Three-quarters of a mile away they
all stopped by a wooden bridge. There was evidently
water; perhaps the drivers wanted a drink. I was
very joyful at the prospect of tea. When I got
nearer I found that all the drivers were saying their
Mohammedan prayers, and had stopped at the stream
to have the conventional wash. The water was
reddish-brown, with mingled mud; light could not be
seen through a glass of it.</p>

<p>I resolved to see what could be obtained at the
Kirghiz tents, put my pack down by the side of the
road, and set off, with a pot in one hand and a bit
of silver in the other. There were three tents on a
hill, and near them many cows and goats and horses.
I arrived in a whirlwind of dogs, three or four cattle
dogs showing their teeth and barking and snarling as
they tore round me in circles. Several women were
employed tending immense pans of milk which they
were boiling over bonfires made of roots. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
seemed a trifle scared at first, but when I showed
them the pot and pointed to the bit of silver they
understood, and I was quickly put in possession of
a potful of hot, smoky milk. I carried it carefully
back to the place where I had slung my pack, and
there I sat down, feeling rather lost or accidental,
and I drank the hot milk and munched a bit of bread
which I had brought from the town. The dogs
followed me all the way to my resting-place, but
when they saw me sit down and take things calmly
they retired a distance and kept up a desultory
chorus.</p>

<p>So I made my first meal out of doors by the
roadside. The next thing was to find a place for
the night. There was no variety in the country, and
I could only choose a place where insects were fewer
and one not over a tortoise&#8217;s burrow. I had a light,
home-made sleeping-sack and a plaid. The sack was
made by sewing two sheets together on three sides.
The sack is a useful institution; it keeps insects
out and is much warmer than open clothing. I had
also a mosquito net, for there are more flies here
than in other parts of the world. Before making
my spread I removed an elegant oak-eggar caterpillar.
I am always disinclined to injure the creeping
things of the earth, especially on a long journey.
I feel that to a certain extent I am in their charge.
This is a sort of natural superstition. Directly you
kill something superfluously, horror thrills you as it
thrilled the ancient mariner who shot the albatross.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_076.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">RUSSIANS AND KIRGHIZ LIVING SIDE BY SIDE<br /> AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAINS</p>

<p>I lay down in such a position as to see the sunset<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
in the evening and the sunrise in the morning. Sunset
was stormy, but somewhere among the rose-tinged
clouds a late lark sang the day out. Then stars
appeared behind cloud curtains, and the night breeze
carried his messages along the heath. The first breath
of night was cool and pleasant, but about an hour after
sunset the weather changed entirely. It became very
hot and airless, and lightnings shot across all horizons.
A shower of rain came down, and the stars disappeared.
As I lay considering the sky I heard far off
the chattering of children&mdash;chattering, laughing, and
occasional bursts of singing. The sounds came
nearer, and presently there emerged a troop of
camels, twelve huge camels stalking out of the night,
and on their backs men, women and children, tents,
goods. A little family of wanderers crossing the
wilderness in the night! They came so near to me
that the first camel snorted as he passed, and it was
necessary for me to sit up and warn the others off.
I had not anticipated that there might be people
travelling across country in the night. They passed,
and the quietness of night resumed its sway. The
clouds thickened, and lightning shimmered under
them; it began to rain again, and then stopped,
and the stars once more came up, and then the
clouds thickened once more, and once more rain
came down on me with rapid tapping. So the whole
night, and it was a pleasant tempering of the heat.
I slept happily, and it was a long while before I
wakened.</p>

<p>When I reopened my eyes it was to look at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
seven stars standing over a blue-grey, vaporous cloud,
and looking like some uncanny Asiatic frying-pan
over a fire. There was scarcely a star but for them,
and south and east and west were all dark. It did
not occur to me that it was near dawn. But suddenly
a voice of liquid melody burst from the sky,
and after it, as at a signal, a whole chorus of larks
sang together away high up in the rain-wet vault of
the sky.</p>

<p>I slept an hour longer, and it was morning. For
my breakfast I visited another Kirghiz tent, and this
time obtained a pot of mare&#8217;s milk. A dwarf-like old
woman was squatting on a carpet in the middle of
the tent, and when I said &#8220;koumis&#8221; she at once
got up and brought me a tall wooden jar. I held
my pot, she tipped up the jar, and poured out
the koumis. Good that Kirghiz women are not so
strictly hidden as other Mohammedans of their
sex!</p>

<p>About ten o&#8217;clock I fell in with two soldiers
walking to Verney (some six hundred miles), their
guns and knapsacks having gone before by wagon.
They reckoned they would be more than a month on
the road. No doubt they would march the journey
in better style with a whole column, but as it was
they were inclined to stop every two hundred yards
and take off their boots; one wore jackboots, and
rags for stockings, and the other Kirghiz sandals tied
with string over bare feet. He told me light shoes
were better than heavy boots, but I knew better.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heavy going?&#8221; said I.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>&#8220;Yes, heavy. No water, and no one understands
us in the Kirghiz tents.&#8221;</p>

<p>We shared what remained of my koumis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do you come from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Voronezh fort. And you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From England.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you served in the army?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. We don&#8217;t need to unless we want to, you
know; our soldiers receive wages.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fifty copecks a day,&#8221; said I, &#8220;and a premium
when they retire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And they only give us seventy copecks a month.
There&#8217;s a difference! How long do you have to
serve? Ah! We have only three years to serve.
But I&#8217;ve seen your soldiers,&#8221; said the Russian.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At Teheran. We stood side by side with them
there. But afterwards it was found we were not
necessary, and they moved us back.&#8221;</p>

<p>One of the soldiers was inclined to talk, the other
not. Suddenly the silent one asked: &#8220;What are you
doing here&mdash;making plans?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said I apprehensively; &#8220;I&#8217;m just walking
along through the country to see what it is like.
Afterwards I write about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For a library, so to speak?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it.&#8221;</p>

<p>After much self-questioning on the subject of
where water was to be found next, we came at last
to a brook where there was clear water. It was warm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
and salt to the taste, but I decided to make tea.
The soldiers sat by and grinned incredulously. I
should not have been able to light a fire, but that,
like the cunning younger brother in the fairy-tale, I
had been picking up every bit of wood that I chanced
to see along the roadway. I had early realised how
difficult it was to find fuel and how precious any
stray bit of wood really was. By the stream there
was nothing to burn but hay. &#8220;Now shift yourselves,&#8221;
said I, &#8220;and go and find some dry hay, the
driest; we shall need all the fuel we can get.&#8221; They
obeyed like good soldiers, and the fire burned and the
kettle boiled and the tea was made. What tea! No
one would have touched it in Tashkent, but out here
on the road we drank it to the last drop and left the
tea-leaves parched.</p>

<p>The soldiers then stretched themselves out to
sleep, and I went on. A mile on I met a Kirghiz
lad carrying a scythe on his back, and he rejoiced in
my company and talked to me exuberantly in his
native tongue. I replied to him in Russian, but as
he did not understand that, but still went on talking,
I reverted for amusement to English. One thing was
clear&mdash;he admired my ring very much, and several
times he took up my hand as we walked and looked
at the ring and exclaimed.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_080.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">A TENT OF LONELY NOMADS ON A SUMMER PASTURE<br /> IN CENTRAL ASIA</p>

<p>When we got to his tent I bade him fetch me
some mare&#8217;s milk, and so I got my evening meal.
I had never tasted koumis before this day, and had
generally regarded it as more in the nature of
medicine than food. I knew that Russians suffering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
from catarrh of the stomach and internal troubles
were ordered by doctors to go to Kirghiz country and
live exclusively on koumis. Now it seemed I had to
live on it, more or less, for several weeks. Some say
it is as invigorating as champagne; I do not know. It
is certainly a pleasant drink and good food.</p>

<p>That night I slept out till ten, and then thunder
and the rain forced me to pack up and search for
shelter. Eventually a little old man whom I met in
the dark conducted me to a Kirghiz caravanserai.
<i>Sarai</i> is Russian for a shed or barn, and the caravanserai
is the shed where the caravan puts in, otherwise
an inn. I was accommodated on an old carpet on a
dried mud floor. There were a score of men in the
room. Some were snoring, some were smoking
hookahs, one was playing a three-stringed guitar,
and the rest were squatting round a little kerosene
lamp on the floor, dealing out grimy cards, calling
out numbers, gathering in copecks.</p>

<p>The roof of the inn was all canes and earth, and
I surmised that grass was growing above it. The
walls were tattered and old, and occasionally a fat
scorpion wandered along them. There was a black
and white duck in one corner sitting on a basket of
eggs. I lay away from the walls. &#8220;Not good to
sleep indoors,&#8221; I reflected; &#8220;fresher and quieter on
the heath; but I don&#8217;t want to get soaked.&#8221;</p>

<p>After my night in the Kirghiz caravanserai I was
regaled in the morning with millet bread and tea.
My host charged me 2d. for bed and breakfast, and
I resumed my journey. It was over a moorland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
country, high and windswept. All day I was climbing
uphill to view points, or plunging downhill into
the rough pits that lay between them. The sun was
a ghost in the haze of the sky; there was a tempering
of the light, and even now and then a cloud
shadow cast over the fields, and it was delicious to
look at the myriads of crimson poppies set in meadows
of rank grass.</p>

<p>I was in better country; there were more streams,
more people, more cattle. There were snowy mountains
on the horizon. Some freshness from the snow
came from them. I sat on a sun-bathed crown of the
downs and watched the lambs playing; white, brown,
yellow, black lambs, very pretty to look at, very
lively. And immense camel herds came stalking up
to me as if released from some pen, groaning,
whining, grunting, lying in the dust and rolling over,
getting up again convulsively, tolling the lugubriously
sounding bells that hang under their necks. There
were many baby camels no bigger than donkeys; as
they came along they indulged in ungainly scampering,
which made it look as if their hind-legs were
fighting their fore-legs.</p>

<p>Pleasant for me to sit and watch them idly!
How different the feelings of a dozen prisoners
whom I saw being marched along my road by two
armed guards, a pitiful little troop of men, some of
them stripped to the waist, because they thought it
cooler so, all very dusty and limp, and all carrying
in their hands blue, empty kettles which they hoped
to fill at springs or streams by the way. Alas!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
there was no water fit to drink anywhere along that
road! Poor prisoners. What to them were poppy
fields, or camel herds, or beautiful views! There was
probably just one thought in each and every one&#8217;s
head: &#8220;When shall I get a drink?&#8221; or &#8220;When
shall we come to a piece of shade?&#8221;</p>

<p>The prisoners went on in the dust; I remained
behind in the free air. In the afternoon I saw a
samovar steaming outside a mud hut, and so went up
and was allowed to have tea with a Kirghiz family.
Not nomads these Kirghiz, but settled inhabitants
with passports or papers. The Russian Government
is very anxious to get these wandering folk out of
tents into immovable dwellings. There squatted
down to tea the owner of the hut, in a rust-coloured
cloak; his wife, in a bright yellow &#8220;cover-all&#8221;&mdash;hold-all,
you might almost say; a boy, in
white cotton slops; and a little dusky girl, naked
to the waist, but wearing cotton trousers, having a
silver chain round her neck, and her black hair in
twelve long and slender plaits, each loaded at the
end with a little silver weight that kept them from
getting mixed up and looking untidy. The mother,
in yellow, had a sort of wire puzzle in her ears for
ear-rings, on her head a high, white turban. She
was by no means a beauty. She looked as if originally
she had been made without a mouth, and a neighbour
had opened a place for it with a blunt knife. The
Kirghiz women are not by any means feminine or
attractive in appearance. As we squatted, each with
a basin in our hands, in came a neighbour from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
fields. She wore a white turban and a white gown.
Her face was deep oak-stain. She had a sash of
scarlet at her middle, wore jackboots, and had on
her wrists three bracelets of the serviette-holder type.
She was a woman cowherd, just in from the fields.
In her hands she carried a little spinning stick with
circular leaden weight at the bottom of it, and on to
this she dexterously pulled camel hair out of one
hand whilst with the other she twirled it into thread.
She was evidently <i>persona grata</i> in the hut. She
had the face of a pirate&mdash;a great, big, tanned, jolly,
horse-like sort of face.</p>

<p>After tea the boy and girl ran off to the flocks,
the women went on spinning, and the father brought
out a bull with a ring through his nose and a chain
and rope hanging from it. He put a bit of hide on
the beast&#8217;s back, and then, to my astonishment,
mounted and rode away over the hills. I sat in a
shady corner and watched the afternoon turn to
evening.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_084.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">SARTS SELLING BREAD: THE <i>LEPESHKA</i> STALL</p>

<p>Presently out of the blue sky came a hurricane
shower of hail and rain, flashing through the dazzling
sunshine and yet never obscuring it. It was big,
stinging hail, but none of the Kirghiz seemed to
mind it. I could see all the children of the village
disporting themselves with the lambs and the calves
on the hill opposite. Not till twilight did they return&mdash;and
then there was for me one of the prettiest
sights. All the children came in riding bareback on
calves or sheep, and driving them forward with kicks
of their little bare feet. The little dusky girl sat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
astride of a golden-brown lamb, and her brother on
an unwilling brown calf. Following the lamb came
the anxious mother ewe, and following the calf a
bellowing old black cow. Many children came up,
and there was a gay gathering and a delicious noise
of mirth and jollity at the end of the day. As a
reward to the ewes and the lambs the children
brought them millet bread and fed them from their
hands. The ewes did all but speak to the children,
and the way they took the millet bread from them
spoke of an unusual intimacy between children and
animals. The sheep were not worried or stupefied by
the children&#8217;s pranks; they were watchful, wilful, and
almost as mischievous as the children themselves. In
these wild places of the world where there is no
civilisation and no pretension on the part of man to
be more than an animal himself&mdash;where, moreover,
man lives in the midst of great herds where all
business and doing seems to be the breeding of young&mdash;the
children of men and the children of the herds are
much more akin. The birth of children synchronises
with the birth of lambs and foals, and is associated
in the aboriginal mind. One understands how the
eyes of the ancient Israelites and Egyptians, those
primeval shepherd and nomadic peoples, were fixed
upon the process of birth. They lived also in the
midst of the animal world.</p>

<p>At nightfall carpets were spread outside the hut
for the people to sleep on. They also lived the night
with the stars. But the children stayed long with the
lambs, and I imagine in some cases slept with them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>I, for my part, decided to push on for Chimkent<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
in the cool of the evening, and I got into the little
town about ten o&#8217;clock at night. Chimkent is a
miniature of Tashkent, but without the great buildings
and shops in the Russian half. The same wide
town&mdash;when you come to it you are not there; it is
necessary to go on and on. The same gullies running
along every street&mdash;only the water in them is less
muddy than at Tashkent. The Sartish shops again.
The dazzling cinema shows once more. I made for
a brilliant illumination, thinking it might be an hotel,
but it was the cinema theatre &#8220;Light.&#8221; Cinema
theatres all have names in Russia, none more common
than this one of &#8220;The Light.&#8221;</p>

<p>I found an inn at length, and a room. Next
morning I went out for provisions. Chimkent has
a little reputation as a watering-place, and chiefly
because of the supply of koumis! Russians are very
fond of going to outlandish places in order to be
&#8220;cured,&#8221; and koumis is the cure of Chimkent. It is
a beautiful little town, however. Chimkent has its
mountain background, its white-stemmed, magnificent
poplars, its old ruins, its fortifications. The Russians
live more freely than usual. No passport was asked
of me at the inn where I stayed. There was no
Government monopoly of the sale of vodka.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> There
seemed to be fewer police about.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>The Sartish bazaar was full of life and colour;
carpenters, smiths and metal workers doing their
work at open booths; koumis merchants standing
behind gallon bottles and little glasses, inviting you to
sit down there and then and drink a glass, the white
of the milk gleaming suggestively through the gloomy
green of the bottle; silk and cotton vendors exposing
marvellously gaudy wares to veiled females who tried
to look at the stuff without exposing their faces, a
difficult man&#339;uvre; strawberry hawkers; hawkers of
<i>lepeshka</i>; carpet vendors; saddle vendors. There were
high stacks of gaily coloured wooden saddles. A
Kirghiz woman, riding astride of a pony, and yet
having a dusky baby at her open breast, came and
bought just such a saddle.</p>

<p>What remains most brightly in my mind was a
long row of silvery-grey wolf skins exhibited at one
shop. It was almost as if the animals themselves
were looking at you. It reminded me of what
winter must be like in this land&mdash;not mild, as one
might expect, but intensely cold as long as it lasts.
The moors are full of dangers from wolves. It was
hereabouts, some years ago, that a whole wedding
party of thirty or forty people perished on their way
from the church to the bride&#8217;s house. The distance
was only twenty miles, and in that time the wolves
tore down all the horses and all the people except
one Kirghiz driver, who by sacrificing the last-left
couple, the bride and groom, and throwing them to
the wolves, escaped to tell the tale and not feel
shame. The Kirghiz would not feel shame at such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
an act&mdash;they are somehow outside codes of honour
and chivalry and religion. They are not savages, but
they are not civilised.</p>

<p>I spent a day altogether at Chimkent. Before
resuming my tramp I bought myself a bottle in
which to keep water or milk against a thirsty hour
on the road. At the shop where I bought it a
strange variety of wares was exposed; first Caucasian
wine, then local wine&mdash;vodka, called here table wine&mdash;cognac,
liqueurs, then ikons, flowers for your grave,
matches and tobacco. Very suggestive, I thought.
The landlady was rather taken aback at my remarks,
and said that in a small place like Chimkent one
could not have a separate shop for ikons or for
flowers or for vodka, and her brother was a joiner,
and she could take orders for coffins.</p>

<p>At Chimkent I struck colonial country, the main
stretch of Russian colonisation extending eastward
from Tashkent. I set out over a very worn switchback
road, through irrigated fields of barley, through hayfields,
where Russians were at work, past Russian
farmhouses, into a country entirely different from
that which I had been traversing. For the time being
the Kirghiz was out of sight and I was in a Russian
colonial district, a sort of Southern Siberia, full of
interest and promise. At dusk I came to an encampment
of fifty or sixty emigrants, with their wagons
and horses. Many fires were burning, and iron pails
full of soup were simmering over them; samovars
were steaming, children were skirling and playing,
someone was playing a concertina, and many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
drunkards were singing. Familiar Russian songs
rent the air&mdash;the old songs which Russians never
seem to abandon, and perhaps never will abandon,
even when everybody knows the latest music-hall
catch.</p>

<p>I slept the night on a hillock overlooking the
road, and it was better than at the inn, even though
there was a thunder-shower. The larks sang the day
out again. I listened to the cuckoo calling and to
the conversation of the blue crows that kept visiting
me, finding out something, flying away, and then
returning with brethren; watched the stars and the
clouds, and slept.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I had now struck the main road from Tashkent
to the Chinese frontier, and the prospect of my
journey changed from one of solitary wandering over
sandy wastes to one full of life and interest in the
company of Russian colonists and Oriental traffickers.
From the moment I wakened up on the hill-side on
my first morning after leaving Chimkent, I was not
out of the hearing of songs and laughter and chattering,
nor out of the sight of wagons, carts, camel
trains and people.</p>

<p>The road was really four roads, each separated by
streaks of trampled grass-grown mud, now dried or
drying after many thunder-showers. On the southern
side you are accompanied by snowy mountains for
hundreds of miles. You would think that you could
walk to them in half an hour and get a handful of
snow, so clear is the atmosphere that shows them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
but they are at least twenty miles distant. They
are, first, the Alai Tau, and then the Alexandrovsky
Mountains, and then what is known as the Trans-Ilian
Alai Tau, and many of their peaks are over
ten thousand feet high, but are not named and
little known. On the north side of the road stretches
the desert in spring, now green to the horizon, but
already turning yellow here and there under the blaze
of the sun. On either hand one sees far-away clusters
of grey tents of the Kirghiz, and near them their
herds of cattle-black patches that are horses, red
patches that are cows, grey, white and brown masses
like many maggots, and they are sheep. There are
also many camels far away on the hills, looking like
little twists of thick rope with knots in the middle.</p>

<p>Nearly all the traffic at this season is going eastward,
and each morning, when the horses are put
in and the wagoners make up the caravan once
more, it is with eyes and faces toward the dawn.</p>

<p>The emigrant caravan starts an hour before sunrise;
the camp breaks up and the oxen and horses
are put to, and the long day of creaking and
blundering and toiling onward commences. I was
regularly wakened up by the road which had
wakened before me, the moving caravans and the
traders&#8217; carts.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The stars are setting and the caravan</div>
<div class="verse">Starts for the dawn of nothing. Oh! make haste!</div>
</div></div>

<p>I generally slept at a distance of about a hundred
yards from the actual highway, in order to avoid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
being run over at night. Even so, I was frequently
in some danger of being trodden on before dawn,
and at least sure to be wakened early by the traffic
on the road. Upon occasion there were whole
hordes and patriarchal families on the roads, with
their camels and sheep and horses, their white-turbaned
women riding on bulls, and pretty girl-brides
on caparisoned palfreys.</p>

<p>We journeyed from village to village, and each
was an artificial oasis made by the Russian colonists
and irrigation engineers. Every ten, fifteen or twenty
miles there was a substantial Russian village; the
farther I went the more distance there was between
these settlements, but still the actual chain was kept up
unbroken to the far east of the colony, and the maps
which we have of these deserts are unrepresentative in
that they show blank spaces with a scattering of Tartar
names of places. The map should now be well
marked with Russian names. Each village is a shady
shelter, alive with the running water of the irrigation
canals, wherein are trailing families of ducks. There
are long lines of splendid poplar trees, solid houses,
schools, shops, a church, post office, municipal buildings,
and so on. A notice-board tells the number of
souls and the date of the foundation of the village.</p>

<p>When the long caravans of new colonists came to
a settlement they tied their horses and oxen to trees,
repaired to inns, sought out people who had come
from their part of Russia, and made merry with
them. The village was a great sight when one of the
long caravans had come in.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>A little respite from the hot road, and then on
once more. I see a Kirghiz riding with reins in one
hand and a hawk in the other. The Kirghiz are great
hawkers, using different hawks for different game. I
meet a Sartish cart in which are five soldiers coming
home from Verney, where they have received their
discharge&mdash;several hundred miles from a railway
station&mdash;and they have hired a native cart, and are
asleep in the bottom of it. At last I come to a
tumbling mountain stream, and it is good to have a
swim and make myself tea in the shadow of the
great bridge which takes the high road across the
water. When a great band of colonists arrives here,
there is an astonishing scene of peasant men and
women bathing. They take to the water as if their
very bodies were thirsty.</p>

<p>We pass through Mankent, one of the few native
towns remaining, and that tending to be swallowed
up by Russia also; and there, at a Sartish shop,
stay for koumis&mdash;very bad koumis compared with
what the Kirghiz gave me in their tents. Coming
out of Mankent I fell in with a band of rich
emigrants going from Stavropol, in South Russia, to
beyond Kopal. They had twenty-four ox-drawn
carts and twelve drawn by horses, and in the carts
were their household goods&mdash;tables, chairs, beds and
bedding&mdash;agricultural implements, reaping and binding
machines, ploughs, grindstones, saws, axes, even
metal baths, barrels, guns, pots and what not in such
miscellaneity and promiscuity, mixed with mothers
and babies, that it was touching to see. The oxen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
in their wooden yokes, were fine beasts, and the
emigrants tended them on foot. Every wagon was
accompanied by one or two on foot, who flicked off
the flies and encouraged the oxen along, sang songs,
and shouted to one another. Every wagon had
buckets swinging at the side. One wagon had
several cages of doves fixed on to it; to another a
poor old dog was tied, and came along unwillingly.
In short, everything they could bring from Mother
Russia to the new land the emigrants had brought.</p>

<p>I accompanied them up on to a wild moorland,
on to a great plateau, where we spent the night
after passing out of Mankent.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As I tramped thus across Russian Central Asia the
great event that should change everything was hidden
behind the screens of the future. The gentle and
innocent present was more interesting than past or
future. It is touching to go over my diary and see
how guilelessly and unsuspectingly I and everyone was
walking the time road that led so soon&mdash;if we only
could have known it&mdash;to the precipice of war. The
every-day was friendly, even though it contained
storm or adventure or privation. We were familiar
with mornings and evenings as with long known and
trusted friends. As we look back at them they have
a sinister aspect as of police conducting us by stages
to some frontier. It is with these feelings that I
look back now to my long tramp to the mysterious
city of Aulie Ata, a famous shrine in the days of
Tamerlane. Each night I slept under the stars,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
each day journeyed pleasantly forward under a
tropical sun.</p>

<p>One night, near the new Russian village of
Antonovka, there was an appalling sunset&mdash;through
a barrel-shaped thundercloud into a sea of fire; and
directly the sun went below the horizon the lightning
became visible in the cloud, and I watched it
running through the dark veils of vapour in ropes
and loops and flying lassos of silver. The thunder
rolled lugubriously, and far away I could see the rain
pouring in continuous flood, the black fringe of the
cloud torn from heaven down to earth. I wondered
had I not better pack up and go down to the village.
But a little wisp of clear sky, containing one pale
star, expanded itself slowly and drove away the great
lightning-riven barrel and banished every cloud, and
it was clear and the thunder was not, and the night
was dry and starry. Dawn next morning was clear
and cold, and at the sound of cart-wheels on the
highway below me I gladly took the road again&mdash;quick
march to get warm. In an hour, however, the
sun was already too ardent a friend, and I took
shelter in a caravanserai, a cubical mud hut with
neither chair nor table, and from the samovar steaming
on the floor I prepared my morning tea&mdash;put
some tea from a packet in my knapsack into my
pot, and then filled up with boiling water from
the samovar. The village street outside was full
of life, crowded with wagons and wagoners standing
half in the bright new light of day and
half in the deep, damp shadow of mud walls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
and banks. I sat down opposite the village school.
The school door was wide open, and I saw all the
village children sitting in desks round the mud-built
room. There were about thirty children, and
they were a pretty sight, the boys in turkey-red
cotton trousers, the girls in red frocks, with their
black hair in plaits. There was only one row of
desks, but it went right round the room. In the
middle space were two teachers squatting on a carpet
spread on the floor. Each and every child was
saying his lessons at the top of his voice, and
sing-song&mdash;but not the same thing, all different,
according to the page the boy or girl was at, some
far behind, another far in front. These were all Sart
children.</p>

<p>I walked all day after this with a damp towel
hanging from under my hat, and as fast as the towel
dried I made it wet again from my water-bottle.
Everyone on the road was thirsty and hungry, and I
said to myself: &#8220;The next village is called Cornucula;
let&#8217;s hope it will turn out to be Cornucopia!&#8221; And
it was indeed a horn of plenty, and I shared there a
roast chicken and a pitcher of milk with a companion
of the road, a poor old horseman who had a horse
but who had no money, and was begging his way
home to Aulie Ata.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much did you give for your horse?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;It cost thirty-five roubles originally, with saddle
and bridle and bags. I don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s worth
now. It&#8217;s peaceful, that&#8217;s the main thing, and it
lives on grass.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>This is really the country where wishes are horses,
for you see beggars riding. What a lot of wishes
astray on these mountains!</p>

<p>&#8220;Where have you been?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looking for a job.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the new railway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you get one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; there were thousands waiting, and they
only took on two hundred, and these at the lowest
wage piece-work.&#8221; He mentioned some figure the
cubic foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much can a man earn in a month if he
goes at it hard?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty roubles (two guineas), not more,&#8221; said
my acquaintance.</p>

<p>Imagine it&mdash;for a job of ten shillings a week,
bestial labour, in the desert, under the Central Asian
sun, something like a twenty to one excess of supply
over demand of labour, and the people waiting
weeks, months, on the chance. Surely nowhere but
in Russia could such a phenomenon be noted. There,
as nowhere else in the world, is a tremendous superfluity
of white men&#8217;s hands. A firm of contractors
has this job from the Government; according to their
schedule, labour was to be paid for at a certain rate&mdash;a
very low rate&mdash;but, seeing the expectancy and
the sad plight of the mobs of unemployed waiting
at the starting-point of the new line, they quite
cheerfully make a handsome reduction in favour of
themselves.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>After our meal the beggar horseman went off on
his nag, and I wandered through the village on foot.
Among other establishments in the village was a
photographer&#8217;s, and outside his little house was
a notice:</p>



<p class="center">THOSE WISHING TO HAVE THEIR PHOTOGRAPHS<br />
TAKEN MAY HAVE A SHAVE FREE</p>


<p>I went in to the photographer, and saw many
photographs of shaven colonists, all very stiff and
serious looking. These were chiefly pioneers and
passers-by, the people of the caravans. It is strange
how unhappy everyone looks in a provincial portrait.
The photographer, however, did a good business.</p>

<p>I settled down for the evening and the night in
the sight of lovely mountains. The sky cleared of
wisps of cloud and discovered the stars. The new
moon, born surely that day, was but a hair of silver
in the west, and sank an hour after sunset, followed
by a beautiful attendant star. As I lay on the heath
and looked upward, the first constellation just
formed, and it was the seven stars, delicate and lovely
in the half-night, as dainty as a maiden&#8217;s ornament.
Showers of meteors, half observed, slipped out of the
dark into the dark; long single meteors left, as it
were, phosphorescent trails of light behind them.
The Asiatic mountains drew their cloaks round them,
hardened their faces, and slept as they stood away in
the background. It became a night of countless
stars, each star a jewel set in the darkness. The night
wind came waving over the grass, full of health,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
gentleness and warmth. It was never still all night,
but never cold, and never a cloud touched the vast
glittering sky.</p>

<p>Next night before falling asleep I witnessed an
unusual phenomenon. Away in the north a strange
black ribbon seemed to be let down from a cloud,
and it fluttered in the air. I thought of America
and advertisement devices and of aeroplanes all in a
second, and then remembered I was in Central Asia,
far away from the inventions of civilisation. The
ribbon came nearer, and as it passed overhead took
a wedge-shaped formation, and I saw it was composed
entirely of birds. They were flying across the heaven
at a breathless speed, now in the clouds, now out,
and never breaking up their ranks, the big birds
seeming to be thick on top of one another in the
front. On approaching the line of snow peaks in
the south, they defiled into a long, single line, looking
like some aerial train, and then easily, rapidly,
passed over Talas Tau and Hindu Kush to India, as
I surmised, just four hundred miles as they fly. The
moon that night was a crescent of pearl, and stayed
a little longer in the sky. I watched her night by
night till she was full grown, and rose in the east
the time the sun was setting, and reigned in the sky
the whole night. How pleasant and serene the night
weather remained! All night long the breeze rippled
and flapped in my sleeping-sack and crooned in the
neck of my water-bottle. Far up on the hills lights
twinkled in Kirghiz tents, and in the illumination of
moonlight I faintly discerned black masses of cattle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
beside which boys watched all night, playing their
wooden pipes and singing their native songs to one
another.</p>

<p>As far as High Village (Visokoe) the road remains
with the Russians, and their villages abound. After
Visokoe there is forty miles of moorland to Grosnoe,
and then for a hundred miles there is not a Russian
settlement except the town of Aulie Ata. Journeying
became very difficult when the road was over
deserted, empty moorland. The sun poured down,
there was not a glimpse of shade anywhere, seldom
any water, and seldom anything to eat. Even the
grass was disappearing, and the Kirghiz everywhere
were moving, following the spring, with their tents
and their cattle and their camels, away from the
scorched plains up to the fresher slopes of the mountains.
Often I rigged up my plaid as a tent, often
sat in the pale grey shadow of an ancient ruin or a
tomb. The emigrants who tended the oxen on the
road were fain to climb into the canvas-covered
wagons and sleep, leaving the slow cattle to trudge
with the extra load through the dust. Russian
Ascension Day came, and the road was perfectly
empty&mdash;for no one would travel on a festival. All
day long I met but one man, a native on a camel.
For a long time we walked within sight of one
another, he allowing the camel to graze when it felt
inclined, but every now and then giving it a kick,
to which it responded by a plaintive groan and a
jangling of the bell round its neck.</p>

<p>One might ask where is Tamerlane, where the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
warriors, the robbers, the camp followers of the
hordes? The Easterns you meet are all gentle as
children. No one needs to carry a weapon. Where
is the old spirit of fighting? The answer might be
found, I suppose, in the thousands of Cossacks and
Russians who, later in the same year, returned along
these roads to fight against the Germans.</p>

<p>The day before reaching Aulie Ata, in the heat
of noon, I came in sight of a green patch on the
moors, and sought and found a bubbling spring of
clear water. &#8220;Here is the place,&#8221; thought I, &#8220;to
make my long-deferred cup of tea,&#8221; and I cast my
knapsack on the moor and looked around for a spot
on which to make a fire. I had gathered a few sticks
along the road in case of need, so I had the foundation
of a little blaze. With what trouble did I keep
that fire going till the kettle boiled, rushing about
for wisps of withered weed, hunting for roots, for a
straw, for anything that would burn, and all the time
anxious lest in my absence the pot should capsize.
At last, as I stood over the fire, there were symptoms
of boiling, and I was just rejoicing. Then
suddenly all grew black around me, and I lost control
of my body and fell down. Such was the effect of
the burning sun on my neck and head. Perhaps this
was something in the nature of a sunstroke. Be that
as it may, even at the moment of falling I got up
again. For what was my vexation to realise, even at
the moment that I fell, that my kettle had capsized.
The fact brought me to my senses. I hardly touched
the ground before I started up again to save the water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
and the fire. No luck; the water was all spilt, the
fire out, and the kettle lying in the ashes. I did not
trouble to pick the kettle up. I sat down by the
spring, soaked a handkerchief, put it on my head,
took out my mug, and drank water&mdash;such a lot of
water.</p>

<p>What a day! I was to feel the effects of my
sunstroke. A great thirst took possession of me, and
when I got to Aulie Ata a touch of fever, which I
had to fight.</p>

<p>Aulie Ata the ancient, the tomb of the Holy
One, is a mysterious and umbrageous city. I became
aware of its trees on my outward horizon early one
afternoon, when the mighty sun had just passed the
zenith and was beginning to beat on my shoulders.
I had made my siesta at noon in a tent I contrived
with my plaid. I tied one corner to a telegraph pole
and tied stones to the other corners, and somehow
made a canopy, and I lay in a blaze of diffused light
on the hard, dry, sandy steppe. Though the wind
blew, it was burning hot, and my right hand was
swollen and smarting, for I hold a strap of my knapsack
with it as I march. I drank the last drain of
water in my water-bottle and made the melancholy
reflection that Central Asia is not a land to tramp
in. I heard the jun-jun-jun of camels, but did not
care to put out my head to look at them. I wished
I had a tent, or a stout and voluminous umbrella.</p>

<p>Still, one couldn&#8217;t stay in this spot all day, so I
untied my blanket from the telegraph pole and the
stones, packed my knapsack, and set off again into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
the dazzling brilliance of the open country. In about
half an hour I espied an old ruin in the wilderness,
and ran along to it, and found at the foot of the
blanched wall three feet of intense shadow, in which
it was just possible to sit and keep in. A villainous-looking
scorpion seemed to be of the same opinion
as I was, but I was too lazy to kill him, so I just
flicked him off into the sun. Oh for some water, or
some milk, or some koumis, but not a Kirghiz tent
was to be seen all around. The Kirghiz were twenty
miles away up in the green valleys of the Alexander
mountains, where was pasture for their herds.</p>

<p>On the road once more! And then like a mirage
I saw the long dark streak of Aulie Ata on the
eastern horizon. It was twelve to fifteen miles
away, but I thought it to be quite near. So clear is
the atmosphere, so prominent in the wide emptiness
of the desert are the trees of the Russian settlements,
that one is constantly deceived as to the
distance of the place in front of one. And I greatly
rejoiced when I saw Aulie Ata; and although I was
tired I resolved to get there without further resting
by the way. I walked and walked and my shadow
grew longer as the sun went down in the west behind
me; but still the line of trees seemed as remote as
ever. Several times I asked myself: &#8220;Am I not
nearer?&#8221; and I was obliged to confess that I seemed
no nearer. It was like walking towards the horizon.
&#8220;There is something of magic about this city,&#8221; I
thought.</p>

<p>It was long before I came even to the irrigated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
fields of the settlers, and only late in the dusk I
arrived at the first outlying streets of the town, and
went in with the procession of cows returning from
the steppe to be milked in the yards of the colonists.
In the midst of the clamour and dust I arrived. As
I hadn&#8217;t had anything to drink since noon, and I
daren&#8217;t touch the water of the irrigation canals, I
was just about as thirsty as it is possible to be. I
determined to stop at the first caravanserai, and there
I had a big teapot and five or six little basins of tea
and a bottle of koumis, and I stopped at the next
caravanserai and had a bottle of lemonade and seltzer
water. Tired as I was, however, I did not seek a
night&#8217;s lodging, but went first to the post office,
about two miles from the entrance to the town, and
I obtained the telegram I knew would be waiting for
me from Russia. I had arranged a little code so
that certain things I wanted to know could easily
be told me &#8220;by wire.&#8221; Letters take weeks. It had
been pleasant to look at the wires by the roadway as
I walked and reflect that a message to me was,
perhaps, winging its way past me. And, sure
enough, at the little post office my telegram was
waiting.</p>

<p>After the post office I found a place at which to
stay, a Russian inn called the Hotel London; and
so, to justify its name, took a room in it and felt
glad to have reached a city, even Aulie Ata the
ancient.</p>

<p>Aulie Ata is a strange town hid behind the
foliage of its long lines of trees. The running water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
courses along the canals, and, as at Chimkent and
Tashkent, bull-frogs croak in chorus. The foundation
of the settlement is Mohammedan. It was once a
great holy place of the Moslems, the shrine of some
antique teacher. But Russia has taken the upper
hand and given a different aspect. There are scores
of mosques lifting their slender minarets above the
verdure of the trees, but most of the houses are
Russian houses. And there are hotels, cinema shows,
restaurants, theatres, as well as farmhouses, shops,
<i>sarais</i>, mud dwellings, and fixed Kirghiz tents.</p>

<p>Darkness had long since settled down on the
town when I went forth to find a restaurant. Here
every restaurant is a <i>sad</i>, or garden. It is fenced
with bamboo; the tables are set among flower-beds
and gravel paths, and there is trellis-work with
festoons of greenery hanging from it, strange light
and shade betwixt the moonlight and the lamplight
and the darkness.</p>

<p>I found a garden kept by an Armenian, and had
dinner by myself at a table under a fruit-laden cherry
tree luridly illumined and yet only partially illumined
by the blaze of a huge spirit lamp. Moths whirred
into vision and descended towards the white table-cloth,
and heavy beetles and locusts stunned themselves
against the spirit lamp, and all manner of
winged vermin and midget danced in the light which
seemed to hang like drapery from the tree.</p>

<p class="caption">THE NATIVE ORCHESTRA: SEE THE MEN WITH THE TEN-FOOT<br /> HORNS, &#8220;TRUMPETS OF
JERICHO&#8221; AS THE RUSSIANS CALL THEM</p>

<p>A waiter had taken my order, and a cook far
away was cooking what I had ordered, and I sat and
rested and considered the day which at noon had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
been ablaze in my improvised tent on the steppe and
at night was here in a lighted but shadowy restaurant-garden
in a city.</p>

<p>My dinner was brought, and all the time I was
eating my <i>shashleek</i> (bits of lamb roasted on a
skewer over charcoal) I listened to an unearthly
hubbub of bands&mdash;or of fire hooters, I could not tell
which. Every ten minutes there was an awesome
silence, and then there outbroke the blast of a horn,
three times repeated, that sounded like the trump
of doom, <i>terumm</i>, <i>terumm</i>, <i>terumm</i>; then came the
sound of bagpipes and a throbbing of many drums,
the horns breaking through the lesser music at intervals
and lifting the roof of the sky. This was an
appalling accompaniment to my meal. I had never
heard anything like the sound of that horn:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Terum&mdash;m&mdash;m,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Terum&mdash;m&mdash;m,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Terum&mdash;m&mdash;m.</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>It was like the blast</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent3">Of that dread horn,</div>
<div class="verse">On Fontarabian echoes borne,</div>
<div class="verse">Which to King Charles did come,</div>
<div class="verse">When Roland brave and Olivier,</div>
<div class="verse">And every paladin and peer,</div>
<div class="verse">On Roncesvalles died!</div>
</div></div>

<p>Like the horn of Roland blown in the desert and
heard three hundred leagues away. After dinner,
I went off to find by ear the origin of this hubbub.
I went along towards the sound, and found it proceeded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
from a native orchestra standing on the roof
of a circus building. Here two tall Sarts held in
their hands horns ten feet long. They lifted these
horns to the sky and balanced them on their lips; they
lowered them and blasted their music over the roofs
of the houses of the city; they presented them at the
heads of the crowd of sightseers, and made many
put their fingers to their ears and walk away: it was
a terrifying and astonishing noise. It was wonderful,
however, the effect of the three angles at which the
horns were blown. You felt the first one went right
over the town, it was a voice from the stars, it
leapt from the dark emptiness of the desert on one
side to the dark emptiness of the desert on the other
side of the city; the second, blown at the people&#8217;s
heads, was in the town and at the town, and caused
the houses to tremble; the third was blown, as it
were, to the dead.</p>

<p>These horns are traditional instruments of the
Sarts, though it is said there are only a few men
alive who can blow them. It needs great strength,
and the degenerating race does not produce such fine
men as it did. The Russians call them the &#8220;trumpets
of Jericho.&#8221;</p>

<p>An astonishing advertisement for a circus. The
sound of these horns was too much for my temperament,
and I fought shy of the show, though I should
otherwise have liked to go in. Still, a new stage in
my journeying had been reached, and I sought diversion,
found a theatre, and bought a seat to see a
romance of ideal love. There were seven people in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
the theatre, and after an hour we were all given our
money back and told that the company had gone to
see the circus. I then went to the cinema to see the
much-advertised &#8220;spectacle&#8221; of &#8220;A Prisoner of the
Caucasus,&#8221; but I was informed that the &#8220;machine&#8221;
was broken, and that the next performance would
be &#8220;on Friday, if God grant&#8221;&mdash;a dark cinema-house
where by the light of an oil lamp, which
seemed strangely out of place, one discerned a
refreshment bar, a cashier&#8217;s box, where should have
been a girl selling tickets, curtains separating the
waiting-room from the theatre, and finally three or
four hopeful or disappointed would-be customers. I
asked a Russian present if he did not find in the
noise of the horns something very horrifying and
suggestive, and he replied testily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, a great deal of noise, that&#8217;s all. Very
trying for those who would rather not hear it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not feel as I did about the music at all,
and his matter-of-factness rather surprised me. The
horns had to me the sense of calling someone, something,
and they were literally terrifying.</p>

<p>In a depressed state of mind I wandered back to
the Hotel London, and found the landlady having a
nail-to-nail fight with a woman lodger. Both sides at
once claimed me as a witness&mdash;the police were
coming, and I would testify. The landlady had
broken into the lodger&#8217;s room and told her to leave
at once; the latter, a great, big, hysterical Russian
woman, had replied with fisticuffs and sobs and
clamour.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>The landlady gave a very disparaging account of
the woman lodger&#8217;s present behaviour and past
career. The woman lodger, under the strange impression
that she possessed good looks, tried to
ingratiate me to be on her side by giving me saucy
looks and knowing smiles. The yard porter had
been sent for the police, and all the while there were
strident cries of &#8220;the police are coming&#8221;&mdash;and the
horns kept up their rumpus over the city, <i>terumm</i>,
<i>terumm</i>, <i>terumm</i>.</p>

<p>I was sorry my room had no key and that the
window was shuttered from the outside. The police
came and ordered that the woman be allowed to
remain till the morning, and a silence settled down
on the inn&mdash;silence broken only by the sound of the
horns of the orchestra a mile away. All sorts of
fancies possessed my mind and wrought me to a state
of terror, so that I was afraid of my dreams.</p>

<p>What I dreamed that night has probably little to
do with Russian Central Asia, and yet I shall never
think of my journey across this wild and empty land
without half recalling it involuntarily. Even if I
believed that dreams had never any definite prophecy
or foreboding in them, this one is one I should take
to a dream interpreter. Now that I know that all
this summer a great war was in preparation and the
dogs of lust and hate were being unloosed, I can say
to myself that I at least had warning that the Devil
was at large, that an evil spirit had escaped into the
world.</p>

<p>I ought, perhaps, to tell first the dream which my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
friend G&mdash;&mdash; told me before I left Vladikavkaz, when
he warned me of a great impending world calamity.
G&mdash;&mdash; said that one night, after an arduous day&#8217;s
work teaching in class and coaching private pupils at
home, he lay down on his couch and dozed. Hardly
had he fallen asleep, when three men of Eastern
aspect, dark faced, bright eyed, brown handed, with
white robes from their shoulders and white turbans
on their heads, appeared to him and pronounced six
words in a loud, oracular voice and disappeared. A
second time they appeared and did the same. A third
time they appeared and pronounced them, and this
time one of them took up a pen and made as if to
write. The words were not Russian, or, indeed, any
language which G&mdash;&mdash; knew, but after the third
apparition and disappearance he wakened up with a
start and at once picked up an exercise-book and
wrote the words down. They were: <i>Imakt&uacute;r nites
&oacute;ides ilv&eacute;na varen cevertae</i>. G&mdash;&mdash; had never been a
student of the occult before, but this caused him to
consider. I begged G&mdash;&mdash; to write them down for
me and let me see how they looked in black and
white.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do they mean?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot yet be sure,&#8221; said G&mdash;&mdash;. &#8220;They are
certainly part of a language. Of that I am convinced.
I have consulted many great linguists, and whilst they
cannot say what language it is or where its lingual
affinities are to be found, they all agree that it has
the nature of real language. I have thought, as I
lived in the Caucasus in the midst of so many Eastern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
tribes, that it might conceivably be intelligible to
one or other of them. I have questioned Ingooshi,
Ossetini, Khevsuri, but none recognised any likeness
to any tongue they had ever heard in the mountains.
I have been to Petersburg, Berlin, Paris to try and
find out what the words meant, and all to no avail.
Specialists were most sympathetic, but could tell me
nothing. However, since then I have made a profound
study of occult language, and have arrived at
some understanding of the significance of the dream.
All I can tell you is that a world calamity is coming,
a great cataclysm or natural subversion. We may
expect great earthquakes. Germany certainly is in
danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dream I had in Aulie Ata was certainly
much worse than this. I thought G&mdash;&mdash; rather crazy
about this dream of his at the time, and I listened
incredulously to his prophecies. But if I regarded
them flippantly perhaps I was wrong. Certainly, if
I held there was no such verity as the occult I was
wrong.</p>

<p>They say that Fear stands on the threshold of the
occult world, and as my dream consciousness impinged
upon it I experienced abject terror, a terror that
creeps through the marrow of the bones and lifts the
roots of one&#8217;s hair at a thought.</p>

<p>I lay down in my dark room at the Hotel London
at Aulie Ata after the fight between landlady and
lodger had ceased but whilst the Sart orchestra still
blew their horns over the city. The bed was a foot
short for my tired body; the shutters of the room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
were barred; I had no lamp, but only a bit of candle
of my own. After a fortnight spent under the stars
and in the immense open house of earth and heaven,
it was sufficiently oppressing and depressing in this
shuttered chamber. But I was tired with the tiredness
of one who has tramped under a sub-tropical
sun from dawn to sunset and has added an evening
of town excitement to the weariness of a long journey.</p>

<p>I had hardly lain down before I fell asleep. At
once I began to dream. I had been invited to a
friend&#8217;s house, and was for a moment by myself in
his dining-room; there was nothing on the table but
the cruet. I was terribly thirsty, and I rushed to one
of the bottles and began to drink from it, but, my
host coming along the corridor and into the room, I
at once put the bottle back and pretended that I had
been doing nothing of the kind. This awoke me.
My eyes opened, and I thought to myself: &#8220;What
an absurd dream! What a dreadful thing pretending
is. Why cannot we be as we are? Manners is, in a
way, pretence. Every polite man who comes up to
you to shake hands, if we only knew it, has been doing
something the moment before as impossible as drinking
the contents of the cruet. Mankind are pretenders.
The spirit is truth, but the incarnation is a mask. The
whole aspect of humanity is a pretending to be what
it is not....&#8221;</p>

<p>I was rather struck by the thought, but lapsed into
sleep again. And then came my terrible dream. In
the depths of my sleep a voice suddenly cried out the
most terrifying words I think I have ever heard, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
they were: &#8220;<i>A great dissimulator has escaped, shut
in prison from everlasting.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>At that I started up from my bed with the
perspiration on my brow and the most hideous fear
of the Devil. I felt that some new evil spirit was at
large and was seeking a home in a man. My earlier
thought came back to me&mdash;all spirits are dissimulators,
whether they be devils or angels, and we men and
women are all angels pretending to be men and
women. But now I knew that some devil from which
the world had mercifully been preserved (from everlasting)
had escaped into our life, and would take the
form and the appearance of a man somewhere. I had
intelligence of the Antichrist. And now that we are
all in the depths of this war I ask myself sometimes
is there a genius of evil in all this, has the Antichrist
perhaps appeared? Does not the fact that St. George
and the angels (the angels, at least, of Mons) are
fighting on our side suggest that the evil powers
incarnate are on the other side?</p>

<p>It was two in the morning; the Sarts had stopped
blowing their horns, there was a breathless stillness.
I wakened up the hotel porter and bade him open
the shutters of my windows. I lit my candle, took
up pen and paper, and wrote a long letter home.
I took out Vera&#8217;s ikon of Martha and Mary, and
put it in front of me. I looked at it and wrote&mdash;wrote,
wrote. I told all the happenings of the long
day past, the tramping, the sun, the far away vision
of Aulie Ata, the strange town, the Sart orchestra,
the Armenian garden restaurant, the Hotel London,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
the fight of the two women, the dream of the dissimulator.
I was afraid the candle would go out before
dawn. Dawn seemed a long time coming. But at
last the nightingales began to sing, <i>p-r-r-r-r</i> ...
<i>sweet</i>, <i>sweet</i>, <i>sweet</i>. A muezzin was calling through
the dark night. How resonant his voice! Somehow
it went with the nightingale&#8217;s song.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">A muezzin from the dark tower cries</div>
<div class="verse">Fools, your reward is neither here nor there.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Again muezzins from the dark mosques of the city.
Suddenly the cocks gave an extraordinary chorus, and
I knew it must be near dawn, and a cart came lumbering
by. Pale rents appeared through the willow
trees that hid the sky. My candle grew little and
yellow and flickering, but it lasted, and I wrote on
and on, page after page, till it was bright morning.
Then I lay down and slept an hour, and I had saved
myself, perhaps, from fever. In any case, I had lived
through a waking nightmare.</p>

<p>By day Aulie Ata was, perhaps, less mysterious,
but there still remained a sense of remoteness. It
was difficult to imagine European people living there
all the year round and calling it &#8220;home.&#8221; It is an
oasis, it is true, but it might be truer to call it a
sub-tropical swamp. It is fed by a mountain river,
the Talass, which flows off and loses itself in the
desert. But there is plenty of water and a great
deal of verdure is possible, a very large settlement.</p>

<p>Aulie Ata has its cathedral standing in the midst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
of a pleasant shadowy garden. It has its bazaar, and
its trotting-ground for a horse fair and cattle market.
Here were numbers of Sartish shops where bread
and hot meat-pies were sold. Scores of Kirghiz on
horseback or on bulls blundered about amidst cattle
and mud. Young men were trying horses and showing
their paces; others were making deals in sheep
and goats. The sheep for sale were tied in long or
short knots, threaded by the heads as Russians thread
onions.</p>

<p>As a general rule a sheep was reckoned as being
equivalent in value to a three-rouble note, and many
of the Kirghiz had brought up their sheep merely
as money, and when they bought six shillings&#8217; worth
of stuff at some shop they detached a sheep from their
coil and passed him on to the shopman. So I saw
for the first time in my life the literal significance of
<i>pecunia</i> as the Romans understood it.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<p>Aulie Ata is subject to earthquakes, and my
landlady explained how one morning she was washing
the floor of her establishment, bending down over
her floorcloth with her legs apart, and suddenly she
felt her legs going farther apart&mdash;by which lively
figure she meant to explain how earthquakes are
felt.</p>

<p>The chief sights of the city were the caravans of
emigrants toiling onwards towards the farther East.
Here were no farms for them, no encouragement
given to settle. For there is now no particular
political need for the colonisation of Sirdaria; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
Russians are far more powerful than the native
population, and could never be overthrown by
an uprising or mutiny. The Government encourages
emigration to the points where it is politically most
advantageous&mdash;that is, on the very frontier lines.
The most vigorous irrigation and settlement work
goes on on the frontiers of China, Afghanistan and
Persia. The colonists have a long road in front of
them even after they have reached Aulie Ata. I
myself went on with them.</p>

<p>The weather changed whilst I was at Aulie Ata;
torrential rain came down, rain brought down by the
mountains, and only deluging their own slopes and
the country in the immediate vicinity. The desert
twenty miles away remained, no doubt, as parched as
ever. The River Talass, in flood outside the town,
presented an unwonted spectacle; the wide, black,
diversified, shingly river, the lowering clouds overhead,
the restless wind from the mountains spitting
and promising rain, the emptiness and dreariness of
the world all around, except at the place where the
bridge should have been&mdash;but from which it had been
lately washed away&mdash;and there, an ever-increasing
collection of straw or canvas tilted wagons and carts,
and of oxen, camels and horses, all the caravans of
the emigrants, waiting, as it were, for a ferryman
to take them to another world.</p>

<p>I got over at last on a Kirghiz horse, and was
pretty nearly soaked in the passage. On the other
side was a more desolate country. It was wilder,
more broken, perhaps a little greener, but there were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
very few farms. Even the Kirghiz seemed of a
poorer and dirtier type. I bought milk at the
Kirghiz tents and bread and eggs at the post stations.
At one post-house I had a chicken cooked for me.
The heat was not so trying on this road, for clouds
had come over and rain had laid the dust. I had a
sense of travelling in the opposite direction of the
way of the seasons. It had been like June in
Tashkent, but here it was early May. Still, the
temperature in the shade must have reached 90&deg; Fahr.</p>

<p>I slept three nights in the open and tramped
three days before I finally passed out of the province
of Sirdaria and entered the Semiretchenskaya Oblast,
Seven Rivers Land, the remotest of the Tsar&#8217;s
dominions, remoter than the Far East, because there
is no communication either by rail or river. On my
right the great chain of mountains with snowy summits
still stretched on, and on my left the everlasting
moorland. More birds appeared on my way, partridges,
bustards, snipe, eagles, cranes. Straying off
the road and up to the first rising ground of the
mountains were a species of little deer, called here
<i>kosuli</i>. Marmots popped in and out of sand burrows,
occasionally falling a prey to day-flying owls. The
jerboa, with long tail and dainty, bird-like legs, was
a pretty visitor, and among insects the green praying-mantis
was noticeable, the cicada a nuisance,
and various spiders and beetles the bane of night-tide.
I was constantly warned against the hairy-legged
<i>falanga</i> and a black spider (the karakurt),
both of which were said to have a mortal bite,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
though sheep could eat them without harm. Along
the road laborious and stupid-looking beetles rolled
their globular homes of gathered dirt.</p>

<p>Slow travelling out here is very featureless, and
I grew tired of tramping all day, the emptiness of
the life, and the dullness of mere sun and road as
companions. What was my disappointment the
second noon to lose a lift that would have taken me
thirty versts on at the cost of a rouble. I had just
got up from a siesta under my plaid tent when a
countryman came along with a cart full of clover&mdash;food
for his horse&mdash;and I bargained with him and got
a seat literally &#8220;in clover.&#8221; We proceeded thus for
a mile when we came to a mud-built caravanserai, and
stopped to have tea. Up to this inn came presently
another cart from the other direction. It contained
all his wife&#8217;s family, the people he had been setting
out to see. They had had a similar impulse to come
and visit him. In that way I lost my lift, and could
hardly share their joy at the happy meeting.</p>

<p>At Merke, however, the second colonial settlement
in Seven Rivers Land, I hired a <i>troika</i> to Pishpek,
three horses yoked to an <i>arba</i> (a native cart), the
driver a Kirghiz. This is the usual mode of travelling
for Russians on business in Central Asia. The <i>troika</i>
stands instead of the train. But what an impression!</p>

<p>The Kirghiz driver, in rags and tatters, sitting on
one hip on his bare wooden driving-seat, lounging
to and fro, one shoulder up, one down, flicking
the three galloping horses with his whip, whistling,
shouting.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>The horses bounding along, neck by neck, over
bump, over crevice, over chasm; up hill, down dale,
never slackening (there is no brake to the wooden
<i>arba</i>); coming with a great splash on to a stream,
the <i>arba</i> just floating on it as the horses plunge
through it; out again, up the bank; what matter
stones&mdash;even milestones? What a contrast to the
way I crawled along when walking!</p>

<p>We go along roads that are like dried-up river
beds, over roads little better than mountain tracks.
Ever and anon I am nearly shot out of the cup of
dry clover and hay on which I am sitting. I am
flung against the sides, I grasp at the stained
Joseph coat of the Kirghiz, I clasp him round the
shoulders.</p>

<p>But the Kirghiz smiles and whistles and shouts
again. The horses whisper hurried secrets to one
another in their rhythmical threefold devouring of
space. We go not by versts or by miles, but by
leagues. There are no steamboats, trains, motor-cars,
aeroplanes in Seven Rivers Land, but the <i>troika</i>
combines these all in one.</p>

<p>As we go along the level high road the whole
country behind us is blotted out from view by clouds
of our dust. We never hesitate as we dash through
market-places and thronged colonial villages. What
matter who is in the way; the <i>troika</i> goes on straight
ahead, always seeming likely to collide as we dash
towards other carts or charge into passing horsemen,
the averted horses&#8217; faces breathing into my face as
we pass.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>The way is always in the view of the snowy
mountains and comparatively seldom in view of
houses. It is the land of the tent-dwellers, and the
moors are dotted with grey pyramids and columns,
the temporary dwelling-places of the nomads. Now
and then a whole patriarchal family of the wanderers
crosses the road on its journey from the parched
plains up to the greener pasture lands of the hills.
They have their tents and all their goods on camels&#8217;
backs; they drive with them hundreds of head of
sheep and goats and cows and mares. They ride
themselves on camels, horses, bulls; their white-turbaned
wives, often four to each man, ride astride
of bulls, their faces uncovered, babies at their bare
breasts. Brides&mdash;girls of thirteen or fourteen&mdash;ride
in extraordinary state in their midst, seated on
palfreys with scarlet horsecloths, themselves clad in
bright cottons, their hair in many glistening black
plaits, each loaded with a silver bullet to keep it from
entangling with sister plaits. They also sit astride,
and ride with wonderful grace, as if conscious of
being the treasure of the whole caravan. They are
good to look upon.</p>

<p>We pass endless lines of wagons drawn by toiling
oxen or little, jaded ponies, and tended by burly
Russian peasants and their plump, laughing, perspiring
womenkind&mdash;emigrants going to settle in the
youngest of Russian colonies a thousand miles or
more from a railway station. We have to turn off
the road and tumble over the rough moorland in
order to circumvent hundreds of such emigrant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
wagons. We overtake and pass the equivalent of
whole goods trains&mdash;long strings of lorries and pack-carts
and camels, piled with consignments of goods
to be delivered all along the way from Southern
Siberia on the one hand and from Orenburg and
Tashkent on the other to the limits of the Himalaya
Mountains. We pass, or, as it happens, get
entangled in a mile of camels, each having on its
back a mountain of horsehair or wool, some twenty
couples of dirty camels in a company, each company
led by a Chinese Mohammedan on an ass, a
<i>Dunkan</i>.</p>

<p>We pass the mud-walled, mud-domed, ace-of-spade-like
tombs of the Kirghiz; we pass ruins of
ancient towers, battered caravanserais. We escape
from the desert into a sort of artificial oasis made by
irrigation&mdash;the Russian village or Cossack <i>stanitza</i>.
We change horses.</p>

<p>At nightfall I overtake a lady going to the town
where her sweetheart lives. She is in a hurry that
brooks no delay. There are only horses for one, so
I offer her a place in my <i>arba</i>. She is accompanied
by many boxes and bags. She wants to go on all
night, no matter&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_120.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;PAST THE RUINS OF ANCIENT TOWERS&#8221;</p>

<p>Twilight turns to darkness, the moon comes out
fair and large, opposite the setting sun. The clouds
are lit with gentle light and a faint colouring. The
<i>troika</i> goes on and on. I lie full length in the <i>arba</i>,
my head on a pillow which my companion has lent
me, and I look up at the sky. The night is gentle
and touching. The Kirghiz is silhouetted above us;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
the moon is now shining full upon us; in a moment
it is cut off by the black line of the roof of the
cart, but even then the sky is the more beautiful for
a hidden presence. We sit up and look into the
night landscape.</p>

<p>The moon gives glimmering illumination to
squads of poplars, waving cornfields, silver streams,
the thatched roofs of cottages, mud huts. The
nightingale sings the short night through, owls hoot,
dogs rush out at us as if they were fired from farm-yards,
but the laconic driver flicks them with his
long whip when they get near the horses&#8217; legs, and
they fall each into the rear and slink back to the dark
yards whence they came.</p>

<p>We leave behind populous villages, and issue on
to the moors. Night hides the scarlet poppies, but
the air contains their odours. The moon no longer
stands over the black mound of the horizon, but has
climbed over the zenith. The cocks are crowing, my
companion is sleeping, the bells of the <i>troika</i> are
chingle-dingling, chingle-dangling all the time.</p>

<p>We have to change horses, however. We get a
samovar in the waiting time, and Zinaida&mdash;such is
her name&mdash;becomes an excited chatterbox. It is
only fifty miles to her goal and her sweetheart. She
tells me how she met him, what sort of life they
will lead when they are married, the name of their
first boy, should they have one.</p>

<p>Two scalding glasses of tea, and then into the
<i>arba</i> once more, with fresh horses, and a new
Kirghiz driver wakened up to take us. Zinaida&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
boxes are corded on securely, her bandboxes are
better bestowed away, she makes a more comfortable
arrangement of quilts and pillows, and we lie back
and both fall asleep.</p>

<p>When next we change horses sun pales the stars.
It is the last change. Twenty miles more and our
winged chariot flies up the courtyard of the town
post-house. I am stiff. Zinaida, however, is as
fresh and nimble as a young deer. A young man
with a pallid face is waiting for her on the post-house
steps, and she jumps down to him in a trice,
and he folds her in his arms and kisses her.</p>

<p>We passed through Bielovodsk and Novy Troitsky,
the latter being an extensive Cossack station,
where all the village men have red stripes on their
trousers, and where even the little boys riding the
horses in from the steppe have red-striped breeches
cut down from father&#8217;s. The Cossacks are soldiers
first and peasants only second or third. Whilst
farming they are understood to be &#8220;on leave,&#8221; and
when war breaks out they are at once at the direct
service of the Tsar on the field of battle. Novy
Troitsky was a Cossack camp in the days of the conquest
of Central Asia, and when pacification was
consummated the Cossacks were invited to send for
their sweethearts, wives, mothers, families, and settle
on the pick of the land chosen out for them by the
Government. There are many such settlements; they
are called <i>stantsi</i>, or stations, whereas the other
settlements are called <i>derevnyi</i>, villages.</p>

<p>On the whole, Seven Rivers Land seemed to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
more fruitful than Northern Sirdaria. The settlements
were very large ones; there were many
enormous villages with schools, churches, big general
stores and several thousand inhabitants. Pishpek,
however, was not quite so large as Aulie Ata. The
populations of the colonial towns on my route may
give an idea of these growing agricultural communities:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The towns of this colony are not connected with
Western Europe either by rail or waterway, and
there is an unexampled provincialism in the country.
The people are far away by themselves, and they
have consequently developed a distinctive local
patriotism. The Central Asian pioneers are great
talkers about their own country, and they are proud
of everything that marks it out as different from
Russia and the rest of the world. They are proud
of its vast empty spaces, its mountains, its wild
beasts and birds, its tigers, wild boars, aurochs, wild
goats, its falcons, flamingos, partridges; proud of
the Kirghiz, of the tortoises, of the camels&mdash;in fact,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
of anything and everything that seems to mark the
country as original. Its people are all hunters. The
engineer, the &#8220;topograph,&#8221; the &#8220;hydro-technic,&#8221;
the land surveyor, the Cossack, the peasant colonist,
all carry the gun. The towel-hooks and hat-pegs in
their houses are goat horns and antlers. The words
of the colonists&#8217; mouths run out in hunting-stories.
All journeys are made on horseback or by post-horses,
and the people are always moving to and fro.
Even the colonists shift about from one settlement
to another&mdash;by arrangement with the colonisation
authorities.</p>

<p>I met many people on my journey: two <i>khodoki</i>,
foot messengers from a village in Kursk government,
sent by the villagers to spy out the land and choose
a plot for colonisation, but now hastening back in
order to be home by St. Peter&#8217;s Day and the cutting
of the barley. Land was scarce with them; all in
the hands of the landowners. The population increases&mdash;so
many children always are born&mdash;but the
free land does not increase. The two <i>khodoki</i> had
not, however, found what they wanted in Semi-retchie,
and were returning to Kursk with a tale of
disillusionment. &#8220;They told us it was heaven out
here, and you reaped harvests just after throwing
out the seed. But it appears there is as much work
here as there,&#8221; said they.</p>

<p>I met a commercial traveller, a &#8220;<i>voyageur</i>, the
representative of a certain firm,&#8221; as he called himself.
He was travelling post-horses, and had a large
chest of travelling samples, which was roped on to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
the back of his <i>britchka</i>. He was carrying Moscow
cottons in bright assortments of colours and patterns,
and when he came to a town where there
were ten cotton shops he went into each rapidly
and deposited a complete set of his samples, and
left them with the shopkeepers for an hour or so
while he had his dinner and had a shave and a
bath. In that way he met me, resting while the
shopowners and their friends discussed his goods.
Commercial travellers in tea, sugar, cotton, china,
ironware and other dry goods were very frequent on
the road, but were mostly Tartars or Armenians.</p>

<p>I also met a boy going home from the University
of Kief, going home to Verney, and in a tremendous
hurry to get back to his mother and the girl he left
behind him a year ago. He was &#8220;agin the Government,&#8221;
and imagined that England was ahead of
Russia in every way, and wondered what the English
would not have done with Central Asia had it been
theirs. &#8220;Just think of the wealth in these mountains,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;Just imagine it; we have not one
mine in this vast territory twice the size of Germany.
We have only one factory&mdash;a lemonade factory.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Its destiny seems to be agricultural,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is student life like at Kief?&#8221; I asked.
&#8220;Do you meet together much? Are there debates,
literary discussions? What&#8217;s in the air?&#8221;</p>

<p>He could not tell me if there was anything in
the air. Life was duller there than formerly. The
students kept more to themselves; but they had a
<i>Semi-retchinsky</i> club. All students from Seven Rivers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
lived together, and they had musical evenings and
dances. It was pleasant; the <i>Semi-retchenski</i> were
great patriots in their way.</p>

<p>At Pishpek I had a delightful meeting with a
Government topographer&mdash;Nazimof, a man of thirty,
of gentle birth, elegant, graceful, old-fashioned. I
met him at an inn. I had been put into his room by a
grasping landlady who would not confess she was full
up and could take no more visitors. After somewhat
of a &#8220;scandal,&#8221; raised by the topographer, it
was agreed that I should share his room. Every
corner was occupied with his professional equipment&mdash;long
iron map cases with padlocks, chests of instruments,
tent poles, carpet chairs, rolls of canvas, boxes
of books, papers and clothes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse all this,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I am taking it up
into the mountains as soon as I get news that the
snow has melted a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>He explained that he was on Government service,
charting maps. He was going to live the whole
summer up among the mountain passes and literally
bathe in snow. He would rig up his tents by the
aid of the Kirghiz, hunt, shoot, survey, chart, discover,
without any other fellow-European with whom
to share fellowship.</p>

<p>We spent two days together in Pishpek, and
talked of many things. His brother had been sent
to Jerusalem this year by the Orthodox Palestine
Society to inquire into the conditions under which
the peasants journeyed and the exploitation of the
aged pilgrims by the steamship company and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
Greek monks. He had brought back just such a tale
of woe and of happiness as I had myself to tell after
my pilgrimage. A good deal is going to be done to
better the conditions of the pilgrims&#8217; journey, and
there is even a proposal that the Government take
the pilgrims on their own boats. I wondered whether
it was worth while interfering, and I told my own
experiences on that journey and gave my impression;
the telling introduced me.</p>

<p>My new friend told me how much he wanted to
get away from Seven Rivers Land and see the world.
Once, as a boy on a Russian training-ship, he had
landed at Newcastle, and had seen something of
England&mdash;had even slept in a sailors&#8217; rest. He would
like to <i>see</i> England, to come and live there, and
understand the country and the nation, to see
America, also Australia. He liked being up in
the mountains, working by himself in the fresh
mountain air, talking to chance-met Kirghiz, shooting
wild goats and partridges. But by the end of
the summer he would be terribly bored. He would
come down from the mountains, rush into Verney,
complete his maps, and then bolt for Petersburg.
He thirsted for human society all the summer
through.</p>

<p>He was always dressed in white, and wore a fez
on his shaved head. He sat with me hours in a
bamboo <i>palatka</i> in the one garden restaurant of
Pishpek, and we talked over koumis, over roast
chicken, over tea, over wine. At night, too, when
he lay on a broken-down bedstead and I on a dusty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
divan, he prattled of his wife and children that he was
sick to leave behind, and of the boy in himself which
made him always seek loneliness and adventures,
however much his heart bade him remain at home.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t change my lot, but still it is wrong
to marry at twenty, as I did. There are so many
partings and it is a great pain. A young man has
things to do in the world, and he is bound to put
his wife and family in the background; his ties
are his pains. Most happy marriages are made of
men of middle years, when they have made a little
fortune and can take things more easily. When a
stout, old man marries a young girl, moreover, there
is generally a happy, healthy family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But surely you don&#8217;t mean to say that old men
are better fathers than young men?&#8221; I urged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; they have fewer stakes in the world. They
are not called on to go and chart the valleys and
peaks of the Thian Shan Mountains. They know
they will not be called on to fight for their country.
They know they&#8217;ve got enough money to educate
their children and keep up a good home. They are
not so fretful, not so irritable as young men, but
good natured, easy going, and a pretty girl can make
one do what she desires.&#8221;</p>

<p>I surmised he must have quarrelled with his wife
a little just before leaving, and be sick at heart to
get back home and make it up.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Pishpek, though four hundred miles from a railway
station, is a promising town. The climate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
seemed to be a hot and dry one, though, of course,
it is easy to be misled by the chances of the weather.
There are long, white streets, with ranks of poplars
on each side, a big market-place, a high road of
shops and colonial stores, many places where <i>Kvass</i>
and aerated waters are sold, garden restaurants.
There is not the atmosphere of mystery that Aulie
Ata has. It is more colonial and less Eastern,
though, of course, there are the inevitable Oriental
hawkers and the native bazaar. Pishpek has a camel
ambulance, a roughly shaped wood-sleigh with enormously
long shafts, to which a Bactrian camel is
yoked. Pishpek also has its lepers, and, as in all
these Eastern towns, there is a great deal of skin
disease, though chiefly among the natives.</p>

<p>The colonists seemed fairly well-to-do, though
there was little evidence of culture, few books, no
pianos; the cinema, it is true, but that is rather a
sign of poverty. But the Russians seemed thriving
and everyone seemed to have plenty of horses and
cattle. In this country, where wishes are horses,
even the hawker of bootlaces in the bazaar has his
nag tied to a poplar tree near by.</p>

<p>The Kirghiz going from the parched plains up
into the mountains let me understand the changing
of the season. The road out from Pishpek led into
desolate country, and I was troubled by the heat and
the difficulty of obtaining food and drink. I carried
four pounds of bread with me out of Pishpek, but
that very quickly vanished, some eaten by myself,
some by ants. Ants got into my bread at night and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
riddled it so that I could not break off a fragment
without an ant appearing in it. I carried two water-bottles
with me, and filled them with milk or water
when I could. Neither milk nor water seemed to
be very good to drink. The best thing out here is
the aerated water, apricot or pineapple; it is very
thirst-quenching and a good corrective to the stomach.
When my European bread gave out I had to eat
<i>lepeshka</i>, which I cannot recommend. It seems a
possible diet when one is hungry, and if you have
wine to wash it down you feel you are making a
beautiful meal. One afternoon, however, I had a
<i>tr&egrave;s mauvais quart d&#8217;heure</i> after <i>lepeshka</i>. A lump
of it stuck in my gullet and would not go down
and could not come up. I thought I was choked.</p>

<p>A melancholy native stands with a tray of
<i>lepeshki</i> in the road, and you buy three for five
copecks&mdash;three rolls for five farthings. No matter
how hard they are, they can be soaked and softened
in tea. But I often wondered what gave the cement-like
quality to them. On the road I have often felt
that my diet was unsuitable, but never have I had such
indigestion as on a diet of mare&#8217;s milk and <i>lepeshka</i>.
It is claimed that mare&#8217;s milk is the best thing in the
world for the stomach. Koumis cleanses and fortifies
and freshens everything; it is the mother of the inside.
But it does not dissolve <i>lepeshka</i>. I was told that
it was difficult to tell the difference between champagne
and mare&#8217;s milk.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, to start with, one is white,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s not the colour; it&#8217;s the quality.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a matter of being thick or thin, but in
the tingling taste and the exuberance and happiness
you feel after it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve nothing to say against koumis.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so on; a poor budget. The greatest disappointments
of this journey were the absence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
fuel and the great difficulty of making a fire. It
took something like two hours to collect enough
straw and withered grass and splinters of wood to
make a fire. And the dried camel-dung blocks would
not burn. As I tramped I made it a golden rule to
pick up and put in my knapsack every bit of combustible
material that my eye lighted upon on the
road, but even so it often happened that I had to
buy hot water at some dusty, broken-down caravanserai
or in a Russian inn or from some Tartar draper.</p>

<p>Night in an inn or post-house or under the resplendent
Asian stars! Hot day toiling over empty moors
and across half-empty deserts, staying in shady Russian
villages, going up the yards of the farmhouses with
my pot in hand asking for milk, drinking about a pint
of milk, and filling my two bottles so that I might
have something better than water with which to
quench my thirst when I was out on the road again;
talking to the farmers; riding behind the reckless
Kirghiz and his three horses; and then night again
and its problems and charms!</p>

<p>Seventeen versts beyond Pishpek is Constantinovka,
and seventy-one versts, Kurdai. Russian
settlement is rather sparse until Kazanskaya Bogoroditsa
and Linbovinskaya are reached, and these are
in the urban district of Verney, the capital of the
colony. There is an enormous amount of room for
human beings here and, when the railway comes
along and puts stations every twenty miles or so
from European Russia, all the way, to Kuldja
in China.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>After the Cossack village of Linbovinskaya, with
its shops and bazaar, comes the approach to Verney,
and the high road is worn into many tracks and is
broad and deep in dust. Along these come many
equipages and picnic carts with pleasure parties of
Russians, and for the first time since leaving Tashkent
there was a suggestion of the life of a large
provincial town. But, after all, Verney was only a
larger Pishpek.</p>

<small>THE PIONEERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ALL the way to Verney the carts are travelling
eastward, but on the road to Kopal two processions
meet one another; the colonists coming from
Tashkent meet the colonists coming from Omsk and
Semipalatinsk. It struck me that those coming from
the North were a poorer, harder, more jaded people
than those who had accompanied me from the West.
Perhaps that was because the journey from Siberia
was more trying and there was less to eat on the
way, or because the people who came by way of the
northern road were from provinces of Russia where
the standard of living and the average of health were
lower.</p>

<p>The pioneers were a rugged sort of folk. They
walked with their oxen and horses, they wandered all
over the sandy wastes looking for roots and straws,
and fifty people would spend hours getting enough
fuel to make a fire to boil their pots. They got
covered in white dust; their boots were through;
their feet blistered; their carts broke down or cattle
died; but still the band went on patiently, cheerily.
They went very slowly, and I overtook many bands
as I walked. I would fall in with the caravan at
evening, and listen with an involuntary thrill to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
great choruses these people sang as they went. They
chaffed one another, gossiped, shouted to the cattle,
sang with as much easy-going cheerfulness as if they
were in their native province and driving the cattle
in from their own pasture lands, and not threading
the road across the silent deserts of Central Asia. I
would see another party afar off at ten in the morning,
a grey-brown mass on the horizon, and catch it
up by twelve noon. And there would be a strange
sight: not a single peasant walking or in sight. Only
the creaking, slowly moving, patient carts and the
clumsy, straining oxen or little ponies, going on by
themselves without the flick of a whip or the whisper
of a master&#8217;s voice. And, coming close up to the
wagons, I would hear snoring. The whole caravan
would be sleeping and snoring in the shelter of the
tarpaulin tilts, and yet going ever slowly on, slowly
on, through the blaze of the Asian noon-day, over the
desert, toward the happy valleys of the East.</p>

<p>I suppose that, but for the instinctive movements
of the Russian people and the seeking spirit, it would
be difficult for the Government to settle these remote
tracts of the Russian Empire. People would not go
simply because of the grants they obtain. It is the
wandering spirit that is the foundation of the Empire.
In Central Asia the officials complain that the people
who come are not like those who remain behind in
Russia; they are the most restless of all Russians.
They have wandered thus far, but they have no wish
to settle down even now. They take up land, build
villages, till the soil, but sure enough after a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
years they are itching to move on farther. The
majority of colonists are people who have come not
direct from Russia, but from some less remote farm
or homestead in Turkestan, Seven Rivers Land, or
Siberia. And these people do not recognise the
arbitrary limits of the Russian Empire, but stray
over in considerable numbers into Persia, Mongolia,
and Chinese Tartary. It is true that the Government
exercises considerable control upon the movements of
the pioneers. It indicates each year what tracts of
territory are open to colonisation, what developments
have been made in the irrigation system, and shows
spots where villages may be built. The colonial
village is not a haphazard growth such as is the
ordinary European village. It does not simply grow;
it is planned by the Government engineers and
indicated in a schedule before ever a single inhabitant
has set eyes on it.</p>

<p class="caption">THE IRRIGATED DESERT&mdash;AN EMBLEM OF RUSSIAN<br /> COLONISATION IN CENTRAL ASIA</p>

<p>When the harvest has been taken in in Russia
many peasants go on pilgrimage to shrines and many
go out in quest of new land. The <i>khodoki</i>, or
walkers, set out. A village or a family sends out a
messenger to seek new land; this messenger is called
a <i>khodok</i>. The <i>khodoki</i> are specially encouraged by
the Government. The police will not allow a whole
village to take to the road and go off all together in
quest of land; they insist on the <i>khodok</i> going first
and booking something in advance. Very great reductions
are made in railway fares and great facilities are
given to the <i>khodoki</i>, who go forth and look at all
the valleys and irrigated levels at the disposal of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
colonists during the year in question. They travel in
twos and threes, one <i>khodok</i> being required for each
three families.</p>

<p>When the <i>khodoki</i> come back, after three weeks,
or it may be three months, or three years, there is
necessarily tremendous excitement in the village. They
cannot then disclaim the <i>khodok&#8217;s</i> authority to have
taken land in their name, or in any case they very
seldom do disclaim it. It often happens, of course,
that the <i>khodoki</i> return saying that they have found
nothing better than their own land and their own
village, and that, consequently, they do not recommend
a move. Many of the <i>khodoki</i> I met on the
road were well-to-do peasants who had a stake in the
old country and would not readily advise their constituent
villagers to sell out and come to Central Asia.
Still, more than half of the messengers sent out come
back with a positive message. They have found and
taken land.</p>

<p>Whether the <i>khodok</i> has done well or ill, the
families set out. It happens occasionally that the
messengers choose death-traps and places of eternal
desolation, and they are terribly blamed. But it
ought to be remembered that Government engineers
and agricultural specialists have indicated the sites as
possible before ever the <i>khodoki</i> set eyes on them;
or a Russian general, visiting a district, has said:
&#8220;Plant fifteen villages on the eastern slopes of this
range of hills,&#8221; or &#8220;twenty villages along this
valley,&#8221; and it has been done simply because he
wanted Russian villages for strategical considerations.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>The manner of settling the Empire is so interesting
to us that I append a summary of the information
given to all Russians desirous to emigrate to
the Russian colonies. This is for the year 1914:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The provinces open to colonisation this year are
those of Uralsk, Turgaisk, Akmolinsk, Semipalatinsk,
Seven Rivers, Tobolsk, Tomsk, Yenisei, Irkutsk,
Transbaikal, Amur, and Primorsk. Also Yakutsk,
Sakhalin, and Kamchatka.</p>

<p><i>The following people are allowed to settle beyond
the Ural.</i>&mdash;All peasants and <i>meshtchane</i>, those engaged
exclusively in agriculture, and also artisans, workmen,
factory hands, merchants and shopkeepers.
People of other classes must, before emigrating,
apply to the governor of the province in which they
live.</p>

<p><i>The Government invites no one to emigrate, and
is anxious only to show all possible help to those who
have decided to take that step, and to make the emigration
laws and the grants and privileges accorded to
colonists clear to everyone.</i></p>


<h3>EMIGRATION OF AGRICULTURISTS</h3>

<p><i>All agriculturists thinking of crossing into Asia
should first think well: Is there not some way of
improving the home land and remaining on it?</i></p>

<p>Having become owners of your land at home (by
the completion of purchase after the liberation from
serfdom), it is possible to let part of it out to others,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
or by careful culture greatly increase the harvest, or
you can mortgage it to the Peasants&#8217; Bank and buy
other land, either in your own or in a neighbouring
province.</p>

<p>It is another matter when the land you possess is
so little that there is none to let out or mortgage,
or when it is difficult to buy suitable land at all near,
when the land offered by Government or private
owners becomes year by year less and the prices year
by year higher.</p>

<p>Then it is worth while considering the question
of emigration to Asiatic Russia, where there is still
much space. The Government assigns land to the
extent of 25-50 dessiatinas a farm or 8-15 dessiatinas
for each male soul. Or it is possible to settle in a
village or Cossack station by special arrangement,
and lease land cheaply from settled colonists. To
enable people to travel to such places the Government
helps with cheap tariffs and money grants.</p>

<p>During the past seven years more than three
million souls have firmly established themselves in
this way, and in many places it may be said that the
colonists have become rich and live in a more flourishing
way than they did on the old lands at home.
But it must be remembered that such results are not
attained at once. It is not a little heavy labour, grief
and poverty that have to be undergone during the
first years in the new place. Not every family has
the strength to bear such trial. It is reckoned that
of every hundred families going across the Ural fifteen
return to the old country after having failed to take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
root in the new. It is hard for families where the
general health is weak, where there are not good
working hands, or where there is no money whatever
to start with. Such families would do better not to
stir; better to work a bit more on the home lands till
they get some means to take up new land and try and
develop it.</p>


<h3>THE EMIGRATION OF FACTORY HANDS AND
ARTISANS</h3>

<p>The towns and villages are greatly in need of
people knowing trades. Especially great is the need
in the provinces of Amur, Primorsk, and Transbaikal,
where railways, fortresses, and barracks are
being built, and where mining, fishing and lumbering
are in full swing. More than a hundred thousand
men are employed annually on the Government
works alone, and private firms want more. Unskilled
labourers, brickmakers, joiners, diggers, bricklayers,
sawyers, locksmiths, glaziers, miners, and anyone who
has any special knowledge or knack, willing hands
and a heart to work.</p>

<p>Wages are higher than in European Russia, and
all manner of help is given in transport. There is a
great reduction of fares on the Siberian Railway, and
every <i>artel</i> of workmen contracted for the Government,
and also for many private businesses in connection
with lumbering and fisheries, is transported
to its field of work <span class="allsmcap">FREE OF CHARGE</span> and taken back
at specially cheap rates.</p>

<p>Many of those who go out with <i>artels</i> like the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
country and the conditions so much that they prefer
to stay and take up plots of land and settle.</p>


<h3>WHERE AND HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO SETTLE?</h3>

<p>In the provinces open for colonisation there are a
great number of specially chosen plots of Government
land at the disposal of individuals or of numbers
electing to farm and work together. The names of
peasants electing to see these or choose one of them
are gratuitously enrolled by the emigration officials.
In the more settled and inhabited places of Siberia,
Turkestan and Seven Rivers Land, where land has
now obtained a considerable value, there are also
special plots marked out by the Government, and
these may be bought. Also in many peasant settlements
and Cossack stations there are wide stretches
of land granted by the Government to the Cossacks
or sold in time past to freed serfs, and on these it is
possible to settle when arrangements can be made
privately with the peasants or the Cossacks, as the
case may be. Finally, it is also possible to lease land
or to buy it from private individuals.</p>


<h3>TO WHOM DOES THE GOVERNMENT GIVE HELP?</h3>

<p>Although emigration is permitted to all who wish,
yet, in order to enjoy the advantages of Governmental
help and grants in aid, it is necessary that families
should first send out messengers, and should await
their return before setting out themselves. This is
only enforced by the Government in order to save
the people from the ruin which often follows unconsidered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
and frivolous emigration. It should be
remembered that all who have not obtained land in
advance through their messengers (<i>khodoki</i>) will find
that they have to take their turn last in the selection
of plots of land.</p>


<h3>THE SENDING OF MESSENGERS (KHODOKI)</h3>

<p>Any peasant or town family occupying itself with
agriculture can now send out a <i>khodok</i>, and it is now
allowed to send one <i>khodok</i> to represent several
families, but not more than five. What is more, any
working man, artisan or tradesman can obtain a
<i>khodok&#8217;s</i> certificate without difficulty, and can make
the journey to the places of colonisation and become
acquainted with the local conditions.</p>

<p>The faithful <i>khodok</i> should make a thorough
study of conditions of life in the new places, consider
carefully all the plots of land offered, and,
choosing the most suitable, inscribe his name for it
according to the regulations. The <i>khodok</i> must not
set off without his certificate, for only by showing
the certificate can he travel at reduced rates or be
recognised by the officials in Turkestan or Siberia.</p>

<p>In Seven Rivers Land and the other provinces of
Turkestan no permission is given to people of other
than the Russian race or the Orthodox religion. In
the case of Old Believers and other sects whose
teaching forbids military service, no permission can
be granted to settle&mdash;therefore, no Molokans, Baptists
or Seventh Day Adventists are allowed to settle
anywhere in Turkestan.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>The certificates, both for <i>khodoki</i> and emigrating
families, are given gratuitously. The <i>khodok</i> certificate
for 1913 is printed on yellow paper, the colonists&#8217;
on rose-coloured paper, and the tariff certificate on
green.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<p>The most convenient time for looking over the
plots of land is from April till June, but the best
are taken up very quickly at the beginning of spring;
many people of foresight get to the various points in
the winter in order to form an idea of the winter life
of the district and to be on the spot when the new
plots are laid open in the early spring.</p>

<p>In order to make it easier for the messengers
and to decrease the expense, <i>khodoki</i> are advised to
go in groups and not alone. A party together always
fares better than separate people can, and more
trouble is necessarily taken for them.</p>

<p><i>Khodoki</i> often take very little money with them,
and, through poverty, are obliged to return without
having found the land they want. It is not possible
to find suitable land at once; it is necessary to go to
various places and look at many farms. For that,
time and money are both necessary.</p>

<p>It is not thought wise to answer advertisements
or apply at offices where the promise of arranging
everything is made. It is impossible to take up land
except through application to the emigration officials,
and they do their work without making any charge.
Everyone who promises to obtain an option on a plot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
of Government land after the payment of a fee is
practising deceit, and complaint should be lodged at
the Emigration Department in St. Petersburg.
(Postal address: St. Petersburg Emigration Department,
Morskaya 42. Telegraphic address: St. Petersburg,
Emigrant.)</p>

<p><i>Khodoki</i> should remember that many of the free
plots of land indicated in the booklet may have been
allotted to other people before their arrival. So it
is, generally speaking, wise to take a wide view of
the possible places of settlement. <i>Khodoki</i> should
obtain the full list of plots offered by the Government.
This list can be obtained at Seezran station, at
Orenburg, Iletsk, Ak-bulak, Jurun, Arees, Tashkent.</p>

<p>The following reductions are made in railway and
steamer fares for messengers and colonists and their
families, and also in the charges for baggage:</p>

<p>1. People holding certificates as colonists or
messengers of colonists are taken on all railways at
a reduced fare&mdash;at a fourth of the cost of a third-class
ticket&mdash;and they are accommodated in the grey
wagons of the fourth class, or, in the absence of
these, in goods trains. Children up to ten years of
age are carried free.</p>

<p>2. Baggage is taken on the same train as that by
which the colonists travel, and is charged at the rate
of one hundredth part of a farthing per pood per
verst, the first pood per ticket going free. Horses
and horned cattle are taken at half a farthing per
head per verst, and small domestic animals at a
quarter of a farthing per head per verst. Fowls and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
small animals in cages or baskets are charged by
weight as if they were ordinary baggage.</p>

<p>3. Baggage is divided into three categories.</p>

<p><i>First category.</i>&mdash;Domestic goods and furniture in
packing cases; more than eight poods per person of
either sex cannot be taken at this rate.</p>

<p><i>Second category.</i>&mdash;Animals, carts, agricultural
machinery, guns, provisions, can only be taken to
the number and extent shown on the back of the
tariff certificate.</p>

<p><i>Third category.</i>&mdash;Grain, flour, seed, trees and
vines can only be taken up to ten poods per person.</p>

<p>Beyond these limits baggage must be taken at the
general commercial tariff.</p>

<p>In the case of loss the railway undertakes to pay
the owner forty roubles a pood for baggage in the
first category (though not more than 120 roubles for
each ticket), six roubles a pood for the second category,
and a rouble and a half a pood for the third
category.</p>

persons, hot food is given free. To small children
(up to three years), white bread and milk is given
free.</p>

<p>People who become ill of infectious diseases are
removed to the Government hospitals and treated
free.</p>

<p>At the great emigration stations beware of
swindlers and charlatans, of whom there are not a
few. It goes without saying that even the poorest
emigrants have a little money, and they stand to
lose even that if they are not careful. Beware of
loiterers, card games with unknown persons, pick-pockets,
robbers. Hide your money in a place where
it cannot be stolen. Do not accept drinks of vodka
or beer from unknown people. It is a common trick
to scatter thorn-apple seed in vodka; the colonist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
loses consciousness, and is robbed. Many people have
suffered in this way through lack of caution.</p>

<p>If on the road you purchase cattle or horses,
obtain a certificate of purchase, or else the persons
from whom you have bought may come back and
declare that you have stolen what you bought.</p>


<h3>SEVEN RIVERS PROVINCE (<i>Semiretchenskaya Oblast</i>)</h3>

<p>One of the most remote Central Asian possessions
of Russia, remarkable for its natural wealth and the
beauty of Nature.</p>

<p>The route thither is either by rail to Tashkent or
by rail to Omsk, and up the River Irtish to Semipalatinsk,
and then 500 to 1,000 versts or more by
road.</p>

<p>It is bounded on the south and east by China,
on the north by the province of Semipalatinsk, on
the west by the provinces of Sirdaria and Ferghan.</p>

<p>The principal inhabitants are wandering Kirghiz,
of whom there are about one million. The Russians
number about 200,000, and there are about 200,000
of other races. Half the Russian population is
Cossack.</p>

<p>The province is divided into the jurisdictions of
Verney, Pishpek, Przhevalsk, Jarkent, Kopal and
Lepsinsk.</p>

<p>The northern districts of Lepsinsk and Kopal are
specially suitable for agricultural settlement, and there
is much land there not needing irrigation, as there is
comparatively much water.</p>

<p>In the districts of Verney, Jarkent and Pishpek<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
irrigation is generally necessary. Free plots of land
are mostly in the district of Jarkent and on the
frontier of China. When the railway has been
brought across to Verney, trade will certainly
develop, so the sale of products will be facilitated
and the conditions of farming very profitable.</p>

<p>Then the southern parts of the province are very
mountainous. Fruitful valleys are separated by great
ranges, but with time a road system will be developed
and this difficulty overcome.</p>

<p>A railway will soon be built from Tashkent to
Verney.</p>

<p>There are as yet no steamers. The largest river,
the Ili, crosses the centre of the province. Besides the
Ili there are many mountain streams and also large
lakes; among the latter may be named Balkhash,
Alakul, Issik-Kul.</p>

<p>The climate is very varied, there being levels of
eternal snow and of burning sand. The chief occupations
of the colonists are cattle farming and all
branches of agriculture. A well-watered farm gives,
as a rule, a rich and abundant harvest.</p>

<p>Wheat is sown (from 7 to 10 poods the dessiatina),
rye oats (8 to 14 poods), millet, peas, potatoes,
maize, sunflowers, mustard, flax, hemp, poppy, buckwheat,
etc. And the harvest gives wheat up to 150
poods the dessiatina, oats give from 70 to 120 poods
the dessiatina, and barley 90 poods. In the districts
of Pishpek, Jarkent and Verney rice is sown, and
gives 100 roubles the dessiatina clear profit. Orchards
are cultivated almost everywhere with success.</p>

<h3>GOVERNMENT GRANTS</h3>

<p>(<i>a</i>) In the measure of 100 roubles the family is
given in the districts of Pishpek and Verney, except
for certain special districts where colonisation proceeds
without loans. A hundred roubles are also
given to settlers in the district of Kopal, excepting
the survey of Altin-Emel and certain plots in the
valley of the River Chu and also in the neighbourhood
of the Lake Issik-Kul.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) In the measure of 200 roubles the family
in the northern parts of the district of Jarkent
and in the survey of Altin-Emel in the district
of Kopal.</p>

<p>In the southern and eastern frontier region half
the loan is reckoned as not returnable to the Government.</p>

<p>In the artificially watered tracts in the districts of
Verney and Pishpek no grants are made.</p>

<p>Beyond personal loans special grants are made for
purposes of supplying general needs, for the building<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
of schools, churches, village barns, mills, brick factories
and irrigation works. For the poorer districts
the Government takes upon itself the burden of
building schools and churches, and hundreds of
thousands of roubles are spent annually for this
purpose. The Government also sinks wells for the
colonists.</p>

<p>Personal loans are repayable by instalments after
five years. The first five years there is no need to
repay anything, but during the succeeding ten years
after that the whole should be cleared off.</p>

<p>General loans are repayable within ten years.</p>


<h3>TAXES</h3>

<p>Settlers are free of all Governmental charges and
taxes for the first five years. During the second
five years half has to be paid, and after ten years
settlers take their stand with the established
colonists.</p>


<h3>MILITARY SERVICE</h3>

<p>Settlers over 18 years at the time of settlement
are allowed to postpone their starting service for
three years.</p>

<p>In Turkestan six years&#8217; grace is given to all over
15 years of age.</p>


<h3>TIMBER</h3>

<p>When there is no timber, the Government provides
free wood for building purposes&mdash;from the
nearest Crown forest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span></p>

<h3>TURKESTAN</h3>

<p>Though, generally speaking, Turkestan is shut for
the purposes of immigration, nevertheless a great
number of people go there every year, there being
a great demand for labour of all kinds. Cotton
growers give even as much as two roubles fifty
copecks per day. Good wages are paid on the
irrigation works. Artisans are needed in the towns
and villages. Turkestan is rich, and can support any
working man who goes there. It is good to go
there and make some money before taking up land,
and also to get some experience of the climate and
conditions. As regards the taking up of land when
allowed, grants in the measure of 165 roubles are
given in the provinces of Sirdaria, Samarkand and
Ferghan, and in the measure of 250 roubles to
settlers in the frontier regions of Zaalaisk and Pamir,
half of which is not returnable.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_152.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">THE SHADY VILLAGE STREET&mdash;ONE LONG LINE OF WILLOWS AND POPLARS</p>

<p>It is impossible to give the whole of this
&#8220;combined circular&#8221; in extenso, but I think I have
included or summarised all that is vital. It indicates
the scaffolding of empire building. The people at
home feel cramped or restless. They send out their
<span class="smcap">khodoki</span>, the pioneer messengers. The messengers
select a portion of new land and return to Russia.
The families of the emigrants follow. But first they
must sell off or abandon all manner of cumbersome
property; and good-bye has to be said to friends, to
the old village, to church and churchyard, and the
dead. Most difficult of all for many Russians is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
leaving the dead behind. There is the whole agony
of separation, the being cut off from Russia and
going forth as a new child into Siberia or Central
Asia. Then the long, monotonous train journey, and
the road journey at the end of it; the caravan on
the Central Asian road, and it is in the caravan
that the colonists begin to taste of new life, and
many feel they would like to go on wandering so all
their lives. But they reach the place the messenger
has found for them, and then commences the great
work of making a habitation of man where no habitation
has ever been before. Prayers and thanksgiving,
and then work. There is no possible living
without work, and the rather easy-going ways of the
old land have to be given up and a new life begun
of arduous labour and unflagging energy. To their
aid comes hope and the passion for making all
things new. No Russian would work so much were
it not interesting; it is real life, the wine of
experience.</p>

<p>First of all, trees are planted. How pathetic to
see the long rows of three-foot-high poplar shoots
and willow twigs! A month on this sun-beaten road
leaves no doubt in the emigrant&#8217;s mind as to what
is the first necessity&mdash;shade, shade. Trees are planted
all along the main Government dyke. The colonist
chooses the place for his house; he digs a trench
all round it and lets in water from the dyke, and he
plants trees along the trench. Then he buys stout
poplar trunks and willow trunks, and makes the
framework of his cottage. He interlaces little willow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
twigs, and makes the sort of wilted green, slightly
shady, slightly sunny house that children might put
up in a wood in England. But that is only the
beginning. To the willow house he slaps on mud
puddings. This is the filthiest work. He makes a
great quantity of mud, and treads it up and down
with his bare feet till he gets the consistency he
requires, and then, with his hand, fetches out sloppy
lumps of it and builds his walls. In a few days
the mud hardens, and he has a shady and substantial
dwelling, and one that in an earthquake will swing
but will not collapse. His roof he makes of prairie
grass, great reeds ten feet to fifteen feet in length
and thick and strong, or of willow twigs again and
turf. In his second year he has a little hay harvest
on his roof. He ploughs his little bit of desert. He
exchanges some of his oxen for cows. He strives
with all his power&mdash;as does a transplanted flower&mdash;to
take root. He looks forlorn. You look at his
poor estate and say: &#8220;It is a poor experiment. The
sun is too strong for him; he will just wither off,
and the desert will be as before.&#8221; But you come
another day and you see a change, and exclaim:
&#8220;He has taken root, after all; there is a shoot of
young life there, tender and green.&#8221; Along the road
I noticed villages of all ages; of this year, of last
year, of four years gone, of twenty years, forty
years.</p>

<p>There are now several thousand Russian villages
in Central Asia&mdash;year by year scores of new names
creep into the map in faint <i>italics</i>. It is astonishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
to English eyes, because we are accustomed to think
that maps of Asia do not change. We like to
preserve the old Asiatic names of places, and our
map-makers seem to have prejudice in favour of
Teuton nomenclature similar to the prejudice for
spelling the names of Russian places with German
pronunciation equivalents. Asia becomes predominantly
Russian, and not by virtue of troops stationed
at outlandish posts, but by virtue of this process of
settling.</p>

<p>The process of colonisation is, however, slower
than the process of colonising the British Empire.
The population is said to increase at a greater rate,
but the organic development is slower. The facilities
for getting to Siberia and Central Asia are greater,
but the prospect held out is not so alluring, not so
fascinating. There is more work to be done by the
immigrant here than in Canada or Australia or
Africa. There are no large fortunes to be made in
a few years, no speculative chances, no great whirling
wheel of life set going. On the other hand, Russian
colonisation is sounder colonisation, more solid and
lasting. It has a better quality and it promises more
for the future, unless we British are going to wake
up to the facts of our situation.</p>

<small>FELLOW-TRAVELLERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT is not necessary to say much about Verney, the
capital of Seven Rivers Land. It is so subject
to earthquakes that it is difficult to see in it a
permanent capital. No houses of two storeys can
with safety be built, so it is more suited to remain
a military centre and fortress than to be a great city.
In order to look imposing, shops and stores have
fixed up sham upper storeys; that is, they have
window-fronts up above, but no rooms behind the
fronts. Singer and the cinema are here, though an
enormous number of Singer shops have been compulsorily
closed all over the Russian Empire during
the war. Verney has its bazaar, its inns and doubtful
houses, its baths, dance halls, clubs, restaurants.
Although it is so far from a railway station and such
an enormous distance from the wicked West, it has
its frivolity and sin and small crime. It has no
electric cars. It has no Bond Street or West End.
One may say, however, that it has its Covent Garden.
Verney is a great market for fruit and vegetables.
Its native name means the city of apples, and for
apples it is famous. All travellers from China are
given Verney apples when they pass through. Carts
heaped high with giant red radishes are driven through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
the town, and the strawberry hawkers make many
cries. Many horses are adorned with fancy garments,
and I noticed donkeys with trousers on. Women
ride about astride, and are evidently used to horseback,
tripping along leaning forward over the horse
as it springs to a gallop, sedately coming up the
high street at a walk, erect like little fat soldiers.
Then, Kirghiz women astride of bulls are to be
seen, and I saw one carrying twin babies and yet
on bull-back, dexterously holding the cord from the
ring in the animal&#8217;s nose, and guiding it whither it
should go. Verney has its newspaper. It has some
hope of culture, and in the High School two dozen
students matriculate each year and go off to the
Universities of Kief, Moscow, and so on. Verney
folk are grumblers at home, but when they get to
Russia they develop great local patriotism and sigh
for a bit of Verney bread, even of the stale bread of
Verney. At the Universities the students of Seven
Rivers Land keep together, and know themselves as
a body having certain views and opinions of their
own. Then, after their course, they come back to
their home land and bring tidings of Russia. I talked
with some students, and found them not unlike our
own colonial students in their outlook and their
attitude to the Empire. They help, but, of course,
a far away place like this needs a lot of helping in
the matter of culture. They bring back books and
musical instruments. When I went out at night,
strolling through the moon-illuminated city, I listened
to the tinkling of pianos, and it was interesting to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
reflect that each instrument, besides coming thousands
of miles by train, had also come five hundred
miles in a wagon along these Central Asian roads.</p>

<p>There is a suggestion of America in the life out
here. When you ask the way you are directed by
blocks, not by turnings, and you may be sure the
town is a planned one, with the streets running at
right angles to one another. Only Nature, with her
earthquakes, has tumbled it, given you chasms to
jump over, and made it dangerous to walk in the
outskirts of the town at night. There is much
advertisement of wares and of persons, and a keenness
to prosper and get rich. &#8220;Getting rich flatters
your self-esteem,&#8221; I read, and again, &#8220;Buy Indian
tea and get rich.&#8221; It is quite clear to me that
buying Indian tea really makes poorer, for it is
altogether inferior to Russian tea; but, then, these
people have not our experience, they do not know
the history of tea-drinking in England; how once
we also had good tea, but that, in the national
passion for cheapness and &#8220;getting rich,&#8221; we have
come to drink popularly that vile thick stuff we now
call tea. Verney has its rich bourgeois&mdash;rich for
Verney&mdash;men with ten or twenty thousand pounds
capital. Among such is, or was (for perhaps he has
been interned or expelled), a German sausage-maker,
who started his career in the market-place with five
pounds of sausages on a plate, and is now a respected
merchant with shops and branch shops and a fame for
sausages throughout Central Asia.</p>

<p class="caption">THE CATHEDRAL OF ST. SOPHIA AT VERNEY&mdash;AFTER<br /> THE EARTHQUAKE OF 1887</p>

<p>The local newspaper had made some sort of record<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
of the cinema films that were shown in the five towns
of Seven Rivers and analysed them in this way:</p>

<p>Which seemed to give a fair account of its civilising
force. I visited three or four cinemas at various
remote places, and was astonished at the French and
Italian horrors, German and Scandinavian bourgeois
funniosities, ghastly white-slave tragedies, and many
visualised penny dreadfuls. When you see the crowds
of Russians at these performances you realise that the
penny dreadful is by no means played out, that many
people did not in the old times read the penny dreadful
just because they did not know what lay between
the covers of those badly printed books, what enthralling
rubbish. The business has changed hands commercially,
but the thing sold is the same. It is
sold in a more acceptable form&mdash;that is all.</p>

<p>Astonishing to see the yellow men of Asia staring
at the cinema: the turbaned Sart; the new Chinaman,
with cropped pigtail; the baby-like Kirghiz.
Whatever do they make of American business
romances and the Wild West and Red Rube and
Max? They seem engrossed, smile irrelevantly, stare,
go out, but always come again. The cinema is a
queer window on to Europe and the West.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>The road from Verney to Iliisk, on the River Ili,
seemed more deserted than the road to Verney had
been. Many parties of pioneers evidently turn south
at Verney, and not so many turn north-east towards
Iliisk. It is waste territory, overgrown with coarse
grass and thistles. There are occasional mountain
rivulets, bridged on the roadway with straw and
mud bridges much higher than the level of the
road, so that every bridge is a sort of hump.
Behind me and behind Verney immense steep
mountains lifted themselves up into the clouds.
The road that I walked was a slowly descending
tableland.</p>

<p>I passed through the little village of Karasbi, and
then through the more substantial settlements of
Jarasai and Nikolaevski. These are prolonged and
attenuated villages. The oldest houses are the biggest
and the deepest in trees, they have plenty of out-houses
and farm buildings; but the newest are bare
and wretched, with poplar shoots in front of them
but three feet high. There are some deserted hovels&mdash;even
a fine house was perhaps a hovel to begin
with, a temporary mud hut put up to give shelter
whilst the first work was done on the fields. I saw
many houses half built, showing their framework of
yet green willow and poplar twigs. I saw whole
families and villages at work on new settlements, and
also families living in tents. On the foundations of
the new dwellings or attached to the rude framework
were little crosses, only to be taken down
when there would be a place in the house for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
ikons brought from their old homes in Russia. Some
colonists, on being asked when they had arrived,
replied, &#8220;Last week,&#8221; others said, &#8220;During these
days&#8221;; the dust on their wagons was new. Everyone
had a sort of Swiss Family Robinson air, as of
exploring an island, making natural discoveries, and
bringing things from a wreck. Some groups, however,
were already busy sowing their new fields, and
I understood that that was the first thing to do; that
was the work, and the building the new cottages
was the play. They had nothing to fear from sleeping
in the open every night of summer and early
autumn&mdash;a lesson to these Russians, who in their
home cottages or in railway carriages are afraid of
fresh air as if it brought pestilence.</p>

<p>I spent two wonderful nights under the stars on
the road to Iliisk, the first in a sort of natural cradle
in a copse, the second in a hollow which I made for
my body in the bare sand of the desert. I passed
out of the new land on to the waste of the Ili valley;
the road was visible twenty or thirty miles ahead,
and on it in front of me are telegraph poles unlimited,
at first with spaces between, but in the distance
thick, like black matches stuck close together in the
sand. I walked a long way in the evenings, and I
remember, as the sun set, an enormous and foolish
bustard that was under the impression I was chasing
it. It would fly the space of five telegraph poles, I&#8217;d
walk the space of three; then it would fly three,
I&#8217;d catch up; and it would fly on ahead along the
track as if it dared not desert the poles. Finally,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
however, just at the last rays of sunset, it flew crossways
over the desert and disappeared.</p>

<p>I was rather nervous at this time about the <i>karakurt</i>,
the black spider that sheep eat with pleasure,
but whose bite is mortal to men; and each night
when I made my fresh-air couch I took pains to keep
out of the way of flies, beetles, spiders, and snakes.
I never was troubled by the <i>karakurt</i>, but I had a
lively time with beetles and running flies, to say
nothing of snakes, whose sudden darts and writhings
gave me momentary horrors many times. The valley
of the Ili is a wild place, with tigers and panthers; a
splendid district for study and sport, I should say.
However, no beasts came and snuffed my face in
the night.</p>

<p>Each night on the road I learned to expect the
moon later and later. It always seems unpunctual,
always late, but not worried, and having that
irreproachable beauty that excuses all faults. She
came up late over the Ili desert in a wonderful
orange light, and then, emerging into perfect
brilliance, paled the myriad stars, set them back in
the sky,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Divesting herself of her golden shift and so</div>
<div class="verse">Emerging white and exquisite.</div>
</div></div>

<p>I lay looking eastward on the sand, and on my
right, in the vague night shadow, lay the tremendous
pyramids of the Ala Tau mountains, the great cliff
triangles south of Verney, first vision of the mighty
Thian Shan. The clouds had lifted off them during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
the night, and in the morning I saw them in their
true perspective, vague, smoke-like, shadow-based
and grey-white, sun-bathed, many-pointed rocky and
precipitous summits stretching a hundred miles and
more from east to west.</p>

<p>It was ten miles in to breakfast at Iliisk. The
water in the little lakes being salt, and my water-bottles
empty, I could not make tea. The lakes
and ponds remind you that you are between Issik-Kul
and Balkhash. It is, however, desert country
till you come to the thickets of the river, and there
the cuckoo is calling, there are bees in the air, and
it is glorious, fresh, abundant summer. The bases
of the mountains are all deep blue as the sky, but
utterly soft and delicious to the gaze, and the colour
faints into the whiteness of the hundred-mile-long
line of snow.</p>

<p>Iliisk is marked large on the map for convenience
sake. One must mark it large to indicate a town on
the River Ili, but though there is a prospect of its
becoming an important trade centre, it is as yet
insignificant, no more than a village, a church, a
post-station, a market-place, and the dwelling-houses
of two thousand people. I noticed new colonists
here, using their horses to tramp great slops of mud
to the proper consistency of mud dough for making
the walls of new cottages. So Iliisk is increasing in
size, its population is growing. Most of the houses
here were mud huts of the swinging kind, built to
withstand earthquakes, and their roofs were very light
and beautiful, being of jungle reeds of a golden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
colour, each stem twelve feet long and ending in a
broom of soft plumage. The River Ili, from which
these reeds are cut, is a grateful sheet of silver, the
breadth of the Thames at Westminster, has pink
cliffs, is spanned by a wooden bridge, and has little
tree-grown islets. Among the reeds on the banks
lurk the tiger and panther and many snakes. Little
steamers go to and fro out of China and into China,
doing trade in wool, but held up every now and
then by the Chinese for extra bribes. In the village
wagons and camels are being loaded with raw wool&mdash;indicating
the future significance of the little town
as a trade centre. The population is predominantly
Russian, though there are Tartars, Kirghiz, and
Chinese Mohammedans. Near the market-place is a
Tartar mosque with a green crescent on the top
of it.</p>

<p>My road lay eastward toward Kopal, but before
taking it I had my breakfast at Iliisk&mdash;sour milk and
stale bread&mdash;at a cottage, with Christ&#8217;s blessing, and
how good!</p>

<p>The morning was very hot when I set out again,
and I took off my jacket and put it in my knapsack,
carrying the enlarged and weighty bundle on thinly
covered shoulders. The land was sandy and desolate,
being too high above the level of the River Ili to
allow of simple irrigation. If it is to be opened up
for colonisation, the river must be tapped much
higher up, in Chinese territory, but this the Chinese
will not as yet allow. I met no colonists on my road
out from Iliisk, not even any Kirghiz. Summer had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
scorched away whatever grass the desert had yielded,
and the nomads had retired for the season and
gone to fresher pastures higher in the hills. How
frugally it is necessary to lunch in these parts may
be guessed. It is no place to tramp for anyone who
must have dainties and must have change. On the
whole I do not recommend Central Asia for long
walking tours. For one thing, there is very little
opportunity of getting anything washed, including
oneself; no early morning dip, no freshness. It is
not as in the Caucasus:</p>

</div></div>

<p>At night I was fain to discard my sleeping-sack,
those two sheets sewn together on three sides; but
the beetles and spiders and mosquitoes made that
impossible. On the other hand, the whiteness of the
sack, when the moon shone full on me, always made
it possible that some long-sighted Kirghiz might
bring his tribe along to find out what I was.</p>

<p>After a night in the desert above Iliisk I came
to a place which was not a place and was called
Chingildinsky, perhaps because of the sound of the
bells on horses galloping through, for scarce anyone
ever stops there, but I suppose really after Chingiz
Khan. However, at the Zemsky post-station, to
which I had repaired to have tea, I made an interesting
acquaintance, a M. Liamin, a Government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
engineer, architect, and inspector of bridges. He
was travelling on a long round through Seven Rivers
and Western China via Chugachak&mdash;a military-looking
gentleman in the uniform of a colonel, but much
more sociable than a Russian officer is permitted
to be. He was riding in his own <i>tarantass</i>, with his
own petted horses, Vaska and Margarita. He asked
me if I would care to accompany him, and we
travelled a whole day together, all day and all night.
Whenever we came in sight of any game the Kirghiz
coachman took his master&#8217;s gun and had a shot at it.
In this way we brought down two pheasants and a
woodcock, to the delight of the Kirghiz and the not
unmingled pleasure of his master, who could not
bear to think of animals in pain. Liamin was
inspecting Government buildings, chiefly bridges, and
of these chiefly bridges long since washed away. He
had to report annually to the governor of Semi-retchie.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are two hundred bridges needing repair
or rebuilding. I make my report, and the governor
sets aside two hundred roubles. A rouble apiece,&#8221;
he explained, smiling. &#8220;But what is a rouble!&#8221;</p>

<p>We passed through remarkably empty country,
but it was on this second day out of Iliisk that I met
for the first time the colonists coming southwards
from Siberia. More than half my journey was done;
I was nearer Omsk than Tashkent.</p>

<p>In Liamin&#8217;s <i>tarantass</i> were all manner of boxes
and padlocked safes, map rolls, instruments, pillows,
quilts, weapons. There was a soft depth where one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
sat and lolled on one&#8217;s back whilst one&#8217;s knees in
front were preposterously high. It was a jolly way
to travel, and we were both sick of solitude and glad
to hear the sound of our own voices. Liamin was
charming. We talked on all manner of themes. His
favourite authors were Jack London, Kipling, and
Dickens. Wells depressed his soul, because he was
so pessimistic. It seemed to him very terrible that
it was necessary to kill so many people before Man
would make up his mind to live aright. The World
Republic was not worth the price paid. He had
read &#8220;The World Set Free&#8221; in a Russian translation,
and he could not bring himself to believe that
there would ever be such slaughter as a world-war
meant. Mankind was not so stupid.</p>

<p>Though he was a high-placed official, Liamin was
all against the colonisation of Central Asia, which
he called a fashionable idea, and full of sympathy
for the wandering Kirghiz, who were being excluded
from all the good pasture lands and harried across
the frontier into China. At one village where we
stopped we met a land surveyor and an old, grizzled,
retired colonel who both held the opposite view, and
they belaboured Liamin as we sat round the
samovar.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Kirghiz are animals, nothing more. The
Russians are men. The Kirghiz are going to China.
God be with them! Let them go! Are they not
pagans? We should be well rid of them! Just
think of their cruelty; they put a ring through a
bull&#8217;s nose and tie him by that to a horse, and by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
his tail to a camel! If they want to stay with us,
let them remain in one spot, become civilised, and
obtain proper passports; then their land will be
secured to them. But if they <i>must</i> wander about
like wild animals, here to-day and the other side of
the mountain to-morrow, then they must pay for
their liberty and wildness.&#8221;</p>

<p>A grievous question, this, in Russian Central
Asia. Liamin could not make his way in his argument
against the colonel. The future of the Kirghiz
tribes is problematical, but I should say that they
were certain to go over the frontier into China in
ever greater numbers as Central Asia becomes civilised
by the Russians. What they will do when Mongolia
and China become civilised I do not know. But that
is looking a long way ahead.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_168.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">VISITORS AT A KIRGHIZ WEDDING</p>

<p>At a place called Karachok we saw somewhat of
the festivity of a Kirghiz wedding. There was a
great crowd of men&mdash;the guests from the country
round about&mdash;and they all stood around the tent of
the bridegroom, while the womenfolk, apparently all
collected together, sat within and improvised songs.
The felt was removed from the side of the tent and
the cane framework was exposed, so the girls and
women within, all in white and with white turbans
on their heads, looked as if they were in a cage.
Kirghiz women are not veiled. They were all sitting
on the floor&mdash;that is, on carpets on the ground of
the tent. They sang as the Northern Russians sing
in the provinces of Vologda and Perm and Archangel,
in wild bursts and inharmonious keening. The men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
joined occasionally in the songs, and occasionally
burst into laughter, for the words were full of
funny things invented by the girls. That seemed
to be the sum of the entertainment. A sheep had
been roasted whole. A race had been run for the
prize of a dead goat&mdash;the national <i>baiga</i> race.
About midnight the singing ended, and the guests
prepared to take their wives away and go home; the
camels and bulls and horses were led forth, also the
wives. And then broke out a quarrel. One of
the guests had stolen a silver button off the coat of
another man&#8217;s wife, had cut it off with the scissors
as a keepsake, and she had countenanced the theft.
The wife, being the personal property of the husband,
had, of course, no power to give the button on her own
account. There was likely to be an outrageous fight
with cudgels, but Liamin appeared in the midst of
the dispute and calmed it all away in the name of law
and order. The guests mounted and rode away, out
into the darkness, by various tracks, on horses,
camels, bulls, their wives with them. It was
astonishing to see the effect of the appearance of
an officer among the angry crowd. They forgot their
differences at one look and the recognition of a
uniform. Even the dogs ceased barking when they
saw the sword of my friend and they smelt his khaki
trousers.</p>

<p>Our horses had been taken out of the shafts and
given three hours&#8217; rest and plenty of oats to eat.
We walked out over the wild and empty moor
together and chatted, came back and had tea, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
then got into the <i>tarantass</i> once more. It was the
depth of night before we moved on, and although
we had clambered in before the horses were brought
back, our object being to go to sleep before we
started, we went on comparing impressions. I told
him my life, he told me his, told me about his wife
and children and his home at Przhevalsk, of his
horses and his experiments in breeding, of the horse
races at Verney, of the joy of the Kirghiz in racing,
the one Russian pursuit and interest in which they
fully share, the common ground of the two peoples
in the colony. Liamin spent a great deal of the
year in China and on the frontier, and had evidently
much experience of the Chinese. He considered
there would be a quarrel with China sooner or later
through the progress of Russia in Central Asia.
But the Chinese would be beaten. He did not fear
their millions. They were not equipped as the
Japanese were.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think of the Yellow Peril; is it
getting nearer?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no danger of it whatever,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Europe is far too warlike to be in any danger from
the Chinese.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think Europe is more or less warlike
than it was; do you think it is getting less warlike?&#8221;
I asked. This was, of course, before the Great War.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s getting less warlike, I suppose,&#8221; said
Liamin. &#8220;But it will be a long while before we are
too effeminate to withstand the Mongols. But woe
for us if there should ever come such a time! They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
are a devilish people. At first glance they seem
artless and childlike, but you can never be sure what
they are up to; they are secret and mysterious. It
is an axiom with me that all Asiatics lie; but the
Chinese particularly. You remember when San
Francisco was destroyed by earthquake the Americans
discovered a hitherto unknown and underground city
run by the Chinese, and in it many white people
who had long since disappeared nobody knew
whither, people who had been advertised for and
sought for by relatives and police and what not.
Wherever the Chinese form colonies they turn to
devilry of one kind or another. I remember the
ghastly things the Chinese did in the Boxer insurrection,
the originality of the tortures they invented.
Fancy this as a torture! A Russian whom I knew
fell into their hands, and their way of killing him
was to fasten a corpse of a man to him, and day and
night he lived with this corpse till the worms ate
into him and he died of madness! The Russian
villagers don&#8217;t mind doing business with the Chinamen,
but always remember they are pagans, and
many think they have direct dealings with devils. I
was at Blagoveshtchensk when the Chinese opened
fire on us, and our Siberian colonists drove all the
Chinese out of the city, thirty thousand of them, and
they were drowned in the river like rats.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time the horses had been put in, Karachok
left, and we were jogging gently through the night.
The Kirghiz who drove slept; the horses also almost
slept as they walked. Liamin at last, tired or made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
drowsy by the movement, nodded as he talked, and
fell asleep in the middle of a sentence. The road
climbed over high mountains, the moon bathed the
track and the wild and empty landscape with light.
How far on either hand stretched the uninhabited
world! It was like posting across a new and habitable
planet where men might have been expected to
be living, but where all had died, or none but ourselves
had ever come. The world itself poked up,
its great back was shyly lifted as if it were some
gigantic, timid animal that had never been disturbed.
It was a wonderful night; quiet, gentle, and unusual.
Liamin, at my side, slept silently and intensely.
The Kirghiz looked as if cut out of wood. I lay
back and looked out, my fingers locked behind my
head. So the small hours passed. Night seemed to
move over us and be left behind, and I saw ahead
the creeping dawn, the morrow, the real morrow,
golden and lucent on the eastern horizon. The sun
rose and flooded into our sleepy and sleeping eyes as
we clattered over the brow of a hill. We came
to the Tartar hamlet of Kuan-Kuza, and it was
morning.</p>

<small>ON THE CHINESE FRONTIER</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AT Kuan-Kuza I parted company with Liamin.
I went off for a walk on the hills; he went
on with Vaska and Margarita. I had now reached
mountainous country and a region of fresh air.
There were green valleys and wild flowers, streams
beside which I could make a pleasant repast, and I
had a most enjoyable walk to Kopal. There were
patches of snow on the heights, and I clambered up
and fingered it just for the joy of realising the contrast
to the heat of the deserts I had come through.
The road went high over a green tableland to Altin-Emel,
where I came to cross-roads for China. An
enormous caravan of camels blocked all the ways
here; two or three hundred ranks of camels, roped
three in a rank, roped crossways and lengthways,
bearing huge panniers of wool, but no passengers.
Chinamen and little Chinese boys were in charge of
them, and ran among the camels&#8217; legs cursing and
calling as the strings of bewildered or purposely
contrary animals threatened to get into knots and
inextricable tangles. Sarts were doing a good business
here, selling hot lunch from wooden cauldrons
with three compartments, in which were meat-pies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
soups, potatoes, respectively, all cooking at the same
time over charcoal. Altin-Emel is an interesting
point on the road. Here may be seen upon occasion
British sportsmen with Hindu servants, and two or
three britchkas full of trophies and large antlers done
up in linen and cotton-wool and fixed with rope.
Before the war four or five British officers passed
through Altin-Emel every year on their way to
Chinese Tartary or India, or from those places,
coming home. Some were out here at the time the
war broke out, and were a long time in finding out
exactly what had happened in Europe.</p>

<p>It is very beautiful country, with snow peaks in
view in the distance and at your feet white iris,
forget-me-not, and brilliant Scotch roses, those yellow
blossoms thick on thorny stems. Then there are
fields of mullein as thick as stalks of corn after the
peasants&#8217; sickles have cut the harvest. There are
good-looking and frequent Russian villages and Cossack
stations, Kugalinskaya, Polovinka, Kruglenkoe.
I passed through a village started only in 1911, very
clean, well kept, and promising. Kugalinskaya
Stanitsa was an old settlement, the land probably
given to the Cossacks when the conquest took place.
This place was very drunken the time I stayed there,
though now, since the war and prohibition, that
characteristic must have vanished. The Cossacks
apparently found life rather boring; they had a
marionette show in the bazaar, lotto banks and
roulette tables, where copecks were risked and
bottles of vodka staked. The public-house was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
full of singing drunkards. I can imagine
how cheered up the people were when war was
declared.</p>

<p>After a wonderful night on a little green tableland
covered with mulleins, where when I spread my
bed I must crush mulleins, I went on to Tsaritsinskaya.
There, on the pass over the mountains and
the Kok-sa River, I got my first soaking on this
vagabondage, soaked to the skin by mist and drizzle;
but I did not seem much the worse for it, and dried
naturally in the sun on the morrow, visibly steaming.
It was quite like a Caucasus road now, steep,
wild, magnificent with gorges and passes, foaming
rivulets, villages threaded with the life of running
water, the paradise of ducks and their broods. The
outward roads were marked by heaps of mud and
stones, and on these I went to Jangiz-Agatch, with
its fine trees, and Karabulak and Gavrilovka; finally,
a day over great sweeps of country illumined by
gorse in bloom and yellow roses, over leagues of
wolf-hunted moorland to Kopal.</p>

<p>Kopal is 825 miles from a railway station, and
one of the last places on earth; a town without an
inn, without a barber; a place you could run round
in a quarter of an hour, and yet having jurisdiction
over an immense tract of territory along the Russian
frontier of China. It was late in the evening when
I arrived there, and when I went to the post-house
I found it crowded with Chinamen; Chinamen on
the two beds, on the floor, in the passage; chop-sticks
on the table. They were all travellers on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
road to Pekin, making their way slowly northward
to the Trans-Siberian Railway.</p>

<p>At once one of those who occupied a bed got
up, apologised, and vacated his sleeping-place, offering
it to me. Despite my refusal, he took off his
blanket and quilt and spread them on the floor
instead. His humility was touching&mdash;especially in
contrast to my own instinctive loathing of a bed on
which Chinese had lain. Fortunately, I did not feel
tired.</p>

<p>I do not carry a watch on my travels, so the idea
of what time it is gradually fades from the mind.
The hour is not a matter of anxiety; dawn, noon,
sunset, night are the quarters of the clock, and they
suffice. But in the post-station at Kopal, whilst the
Chinese were officiously effacing themselves, I found
myself idly looking at the big clock hanging in a
shadowy corner and trying to make out the hour.
The face of the clock was a tiger looking at a snake.
When it was twelve o&#8217;clock the hands were between
the tiger&#8217;s eyes. At a quarter-past seven the hands
held the serpent. The clock was very dusty, but
imagine the start I got when suddenly I saw that the
eyes in the tiger face were rolling at me. As I stared
the pupils slowly moved across the whites of the eyes.
The pendulum made the eyes roll.</p>

<p>It was only nine o&#8217;clock, and I had noticed as I
came into the town a considerable flare of lights, a
large white tent, and a notice of a Chinese circus.
A Chinese circus was something not to be missed in
this empty and outlandish country, so I put down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
my pack in the post-house and went out to see the
performance. It was something truly original, a
piquant diversion after a long day&#8217;s journeying in the
wastes and wilds of the mountains of Alai Tau.</p>

<p>It was a circular tent, small enough for a circus
tent, having only three rows of seats around the
arena. The price to sit down was thirty copecks, to
stand behind, fifteen copecks. Soldiers came in free,
and there were some thirty of them, with their dull
peasant faces and dusty khaki uniforms. Near the
entrance there was a box covered with red bunting,
free for the chief of police and his friends. The
chief of police has a free box at nearly every local
entertainment in Russia&mdash;he can permit or forbid
the show. There were three musicians&mdash;Russian
peasants, paid a shilling a night, I understand&mdash;and
they gave value for money unceasingly on a
concertina, a violin, and a balalaika. The public on
the bare, rickety forms ringed round the as yet
empty stage numbered from 100 to 120, and were
a mixture of Russians, Tartars, and Kirghiz. All
the Russian officers and officials of the town seemed
to be there, and were accompanied by their smartly
dressed wives and daughters. The Tartar merchants
looked grim in their black skull-caps, their women
queenly, with little crowns on the tops of their heads
and long veils falling over their hair and their backs.
There was a row of these crowned Tartar women
together; a row also of Kirghiz women, in high,
white turbans wrapped about their broad brows.
There were colonists and their <i>babas</i>&mdash;open-faced,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
simple-souled peasant women who came to be petrified
by the seeming devilry of the heathen Chinee.
To them the fact that the Chinese are heathen&mdash;not
Christian&mdash;is no joke, but a fierce reality. They look
upon the Chinese as being comparatively near akin
to devils.</p>

<p>Naphtha lamps swung uneasily from the high
beams of the tent, and flung unequal volumes of
light from dangerous-looking ragged flames. The
sandy arena and all the eager people round were
brightly shown in the plenitude of light.</p>

<p>The first item on the programme was not particularly
striking. A bell was rung, and a little
Chinaman in black came out and twirled and juggled
a tea-tray on a chopstick. Then followed a Russian
clown with painted face, old hat, and yellow
wig, who proceeded to be very serious and show the
public various tricks. He had three Chinese servants,
and the fun consisted in their stealing his things and
spoiling his efforts. Finally, he took a big stick
and chased them round and round the arena&mdash;to
the great delight of all the children present.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_178.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">CHINESE PRAYING-HOUSE AT DJARKENT</p>

<p>The clown&#8217;s turn ended, there came forward a
very handsome Chinee in black satin knee-breeches,
tight stockings, scarlet jersey, and English collar and
tie. He was rather tall, had a big, womanish face,
gleaming teeth, and long, black hair. He walked
jauntily in little slippers, and carried a handful of
ten knives. Another Chinaman came out with an
old tree trunk, which he held up on end. A child
came and stood up against the trunk. The handsome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
Chinee then stood and flung the knives as if to pin
the boy to the wood, and he planted them between
the child&#8217;s arm and his body, over his arm, between
his legs and beside his legs, on each side of his neck,
on each side of his ears, and over his head&mdash;and all
the time as he flung them he smiled. He repeated
his feat, placing all the knives round about the boy&#8217;s
head, never raising the skin.</p>

<p>Number four was the owner of the troupe, an
old fellow in a light blue, voluminous smock and
long pigtail. He conjured a platter of biscuits and
cakes, glasses, a teapot, a steaming samovar, all out
of nothingness, inviting the public to come and
have tea with him, and talking an amusing broken
Russian:</p>

<p>&#8220;You laugh, you think this fine trick, but I
show you &#8217;nother mighty juggle; took me ten years
to learn this juggle ...&#8221; and so on.</p>

<p>As the applause dies down the bell rings again,
and out comes the &#8220;Chinaman with the cast-iron
head.&#8221; All the time &#8220;the orchestra&#8221; plays Russian
dances, plays them very noisily. He with the iron
head lies down on the sand and puts two bricks on
his temple. At a distance of ten yards another
Chinaman holds a brick and prepares to aim it at the
head of his prostrate fellow-player. He aims it, but
the iron-headed one pretends to lose his nerve and
jumps up with a terrible scream, pointing to the
music. The music must be calmed down. The
audience holds its breath as the trick is repeated to
gentle lullaby airs. This time the prostrate man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
receives the bricks one by one as they are aimed&mdash;square
on the bricks lying on his temple&mdash;and, of
course, is none the worse, though he takes the risk
of a bad shot.</p>

<p>The old conjurer came out again and danced to
the Russian Kamarinsky air, holding a bamboo as if
it were his partner, and doing all manner of clever
and amusing turns. The young man who juggled
the tea-tray on the chopstick reappeared, and did a
difficult balancing trick, raising himself on a trestle
which rested on little spheres on a table. Then came
two most original items, the dancing of an old man
in a five-yard linen whip, and the rolling round the
body of a rusty eight-foot iron sceptre.</p>

<p>The man who danced made the long whip of linen
crack and roll out over the arena in splendid circles
and waves, and he was ever in the midst of it. The
juggler of the sceptre contrived to roll the strange-looking
implement all over his body, about his back
and his shoulders and his stomach, and never let it
touch the ground and never touched it with his hand&mdash;and
at the same time to dance to the music. This
was a most attractive feat, and was as pleasant
to watch as anything I had ever seen in a large
city.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_180.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">LEPERS IN A FRONTIER TOWN</p>

<p>There was an interval and a great buzz of talking
and surmise. After the interval came wrestling
matches and trick-riding on bicycles. A clever little
Mongol had no difficulty in disposing of those who
offered to wrestle with him, and a Russian cyclist
who rode on his handle-bars received great applause<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
from the people of Kopal, most of whom had not
seen a bicycle before.</p>

<p>So the entertainment ended, and everyone was
well pleased. The juggling was a great mystification
to the simple Russians, and I heard many amusing
comments from those behind me and beside. The conjuring
forth of the steaming samovar was especially
troubling to the minds of the peasant women, and I
heard one say to another:</p>

<p>&#8220;God knows where he got it from.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the other replied seriously:</p>

<p>&#8220;What has God got to do with it? It&#8217;s the
power o&#8217; Satan.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I returned to my post-house in a pleasant frame
of mind; it was one by the clock with the tiger
face, and I took out my sheets and blanket and
slept in a wagon in the yard. All the Chinese were
snoring.</p>

<p>I said Kopal had no barber, but next day I
found a Sart who shaved. I entered a dwelling in
the bazaar, half home, half cave. Picture me sitting
on a rag of carpet on the floor of a mud hut, a red
handkerchief tied tightly round my neck. A bald-headed
old Mohammedan holds in his hand a broken
mug containing vinegar. He dips his thumb in the
vinegar, and then massages my cheeks and chin and
neck. It was queer to feel his broad thumb pounding
against my skin and chinbone. He made no
lather, but he thought that he softened my skin
with his hard thumb and the vinegar. Then he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
brandished a broken razor over my head, and fairly
tore the hair off my face with it. He gave me no
water with which to rinse, but as he finished his job
he put into my hand three inches of broken mirror
so that I could survey my new countenance and judge
whether he had done well.</p>

<p>The Chinese at the post-house behaved like
Christians, or, rather, as Christians should, with
great humbleness and altruism, giving up the samovar
to Russian visitors, fetching water to fill the
washing-bowls, cleaning and drying the dishes after
their breakfast, and sweeping the post-room floor
before they went away. The postmaster&#8217;s wife said
there was a constant flow of Chinese, and they
always behaved in that way.</p>

<p>Kopal, four thousand feet above the sea level, is
in the midst of fine scenery, and the frontier all the
way to Chugachak and the shoulder of the Altai
mountains is wild and desolate. The boundary is
marked by numbered poles, but there are few soldiers
or excisemen to question you if you cross either
way. There is a certain amount of smuggling done,
one of the articles brought through from China being
Havana cigars, of which the local bureaucracy is
said to be fond.</p>

<p>Sportsmen on the road to Kuldja sometimes put
up at Kopal. They are given facilities to make
such journeys and receive honourable treatment, their
names being forwarded to all the postmasters on
the way and instructions being posted in all the
post-houses along the road. It was interesting to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
read on the post-house walls notices of the following
type:</p>

<p>&#8220;There will pass this way&#8221; (then would come
an English name). &#8220;You are to give him horses
and all of which he may stand in need. In the case
of his being hindered for any reason, you will be
severely punished.&#8221;</p>

<p>These English often possess their own <i>tarantasses</i>,
and sleep in them at night. In that way they avoid
the unpleasantness of sleeping in a room full of
Chinese. On the whole it is better to sleep out of
doors than in.</p>

<small>&#8220;MIDSUMMER NIGHT AMONG THE TENT-DWELLERS&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;WALKED forth from Kopal on a broad moorland
road, and after several hours&#8217; upland tramping
came to the Cossack village of Arazan&mdash;a typical
willow-shaded settlement with irrigation streamlets
rushing along the channels between the roadway and
the cottages. Here, at the house of a herculean old
soldier, I was offered for dinner a dish of hot milk,
ten lightly boiled eggs, and a hunch of black bread&mdash;the
typical meal of the day for a wanderer in these
parts. In the pleasant coolness of five o&#8217;clock sunshine
I passed out at the other end of the only
street of the village and climbed up into the hills
beyond. I turned a neck in the mountains, descended
by little green gorges into strange valleys, and
climbed out of them to high ridges and cold, windswept
heights. All about me grew desolate and
rugged. It was touching to look back at the little
collection of homes that I had left&mdash;the compact,
little island of trees in the ocean of moorland below
me and behind me&mdash;and look forward to the pass
where all seemed dreadful and forbidding in front.</p>

<p>In such a view I spread my bed and slept. The
hill-side was covered with mullein stalks, and as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
grew dark these stalks seemed to grow taller and
taller and blacker all about me till they looked like
a great wood of telegraph poles. The vast dark
masses of the mountains dreamed, and in the lightly
clouded heaven stars peeped across the world, rain-laden
winds blew over me, and I had as lief it rained
as not, so dry was everything after weeks of summer
heat. But no rain came, though the winds were
cool and the night was sweet.</p>

<p>Next morning, with great difficulty, I collected
roots and withered grass enough to boil a pot and
make my morning tea, and I sat and ate my breakfast
in the presence of Mrs. Stonechat and her four
fluffy little youngsters, gurgling and chirping and
not afraid to sit on the same bank with me, while
their mother harangued them on &#8220;How to fly.&#8221;
While sitting there the large raindrops came at last,
and they made deep black spots in the dust of the
road, the lightning flashed across my knife, the
thunder rolled boulders about the mountains, and I
sped to a cave to avoid a drenching shower.</p>

<p>I was in a somewhat celebrated district. The
Pass and the Gorge of Abakum are among the
sights of Seven Rivers Land, and are visited by
Russian holiday-makers and picnickers. All the
rocks are scrawled with the names of bygone visitors,
and by that fact alone you know the place has a
name and is accounted beautiful. When the rain
ceased, and I ventured out of the cave again, I saw
a Russian at work writing his name. He had a stick
dipped in the compound with which the axles of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
cart-wheels were oiled, and the wheels of the cart were
nearly off for him to get it. For the first time I
saw how these intensely black scrawls of names and
signatures are written on the rocks. We are content
to scratch our names with a bit of glass or a nail, or
to chalk them, or cut them with a pocket-knife; but
the Russians are fond of bold, black signatures two
or three feet long, and they make them with this
pitch and oil from the wheels of their carts.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant noontide on the narrow road,
between crumbling indigo rocks and heaped debris.
The stony slopes were rain-washed, the air fresh, and
all along the way these dwarf rose bushes which I
had seen on the road to Kopal, thorny, but covered
with scores of bright yellow blossoms on little red
stems. The jagged highway climbed again high up&mdash;to
the sky, and gave me a vision of a new land,
the vast dead plain of Northern Semi-retchie and of
Southern Siberia. Northward to the horizon lay
deserts, salt marshes, and vast lakes with uninhabited
shores, withered moors and wilted lowlands. I saw
at a glance how uninteresting my road was to
become if I persevered straight ahead towards Semipalatinsk,
and I resolved to keep to the mountains in
which I found myself, and follow them eastward and
north-eastward to the remoter town of Lepsinsk.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_186.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">A PATRIARCHAL KIRGHIZ FAMILY</p>

<p>From that height, which was evidently the
famous pass, I descended into the pretty gorge of
Abakum. The road was steep and narrow, the cliffs
on each side sheer. A little foaming stream runs
down from the cliffs, over rubbish heaps of rocks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
and accompanies the highway in an artificially devised
channel. A strange gateway has been formed in a
thin partition of rock, and through this runs the
stream below and the telegraph wire overhead; there
is a footway, but carts are obliged to make a detour.
At this gateway and on the rocks I saw a further
intimation of commercial Siberia. Commercial travellers
had scrawled:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>BUY PROVODNIK GALOSHES AT OMSK</p>
</div>

<p>and</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>BUY INDIAN TEA AND GET RICH</p>
</div>

<p>which was almost as if I had seen in the midst of
the wilderness something like &#8220;Owbridge&#8217;s Lung
Tonic: 4,000 miles to London.&#8221; Still, these advertisements
of galoshes and tea were scrawled, not
printed, and were done voluntarily by enthusiastic
travellers who probably received no fee for doing such
a thing. In England you cut your Rosalind&#8217;s name
on the tree; in Russia your own name; in America
you write what O. Henry called &#8220;your especial line
of graft,&#8221; and all the New World is scrawled with
hand-written advertisements of trade. So in the
far-off gorge of Abakum I saw a suggestion of the
America of the future-great commercial Siberia, to
which perchance, some day, Americans will emigrate
for work as the Russians emigrate to America
to-day.</p>

<p>I felt this pass and gateway to be the entrance
to Siberia, though, politically, the frontier is about
three hundred miles distant. After six or seven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
turns the road issued forth upon a level strand of
green and grey&mdash;the Siberian southern steppe. Lepsinsk,
my next point, was the first town with a
name ending in &#8220;sk,&#8221; and there are scarcely more
than four towns in Siberia not ending so. None of
the emigrant carts that I now met were coming
from the south, but all from Siberia, and many of
the emigrants were Siberians discontented with their
northern holdings. They seemed poor people, and
the caravans were rather woebegone. There is a
good deal of land offered to the emigrants in the
neighbourhood of Lepsinsk, most of it contiguous to
the Chinese boundary; but, though it is green and
fertile, it is as hard a land to settle as the plains in
the south. The Siberians missed the pine forests,
the shelter and the fuel of them, and it was a sight
to see the straggling procession of women behind the
dust-covered wagons&mdash;they had to spread themselves
about the moor and the roadway, and search for
roots and splinters of wood with which to make a fire
at the end of their day&#8217;s journey. All the women
held their aprons or petticoats up, and gathered the
fuel into their laps. It took them nearly all day to
get enough for the fires to boil the nightly soup.</p>

<p>For me, however, it was a green and joyous road
from Abakum eastward to Sarkand, keeping to the
mountain slopes and not faring forth upon the
scorched plain that lies away northward. I did not
repent that the cross-roads tempted me to go eastward,
hugging the mountains. Long green grass
waved on each side of the road, and in the grass blue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
larkspur and immense yellow hollyhocks. I was in
the land where the Kirghiz has his summer pasture,
and often I came upon whole clans that had just
pitched their tents. It was a many-coloured picture
of camels, bulls and horses, of sheep swarming among
children, of kittens playing with one another&#8217;s tails,
of tents whose framework only was as yet put up,
of heaps of felt and carpet on the grass, of old
wooden chests and antediluvian pots and jugs of
sagging leather lying promiscuously together, while
the new home was not made. On this road the
Chinese jugglers overtook me and camped very near
where I slept one night. I was amused to see the
old conjurer who had juggled the steaming samovar
out of thin air hunting mournfully for bits of wood
and roots to make that same samovar boil in real
earnest.</p>

<p>Next day I came to the village of Jaiman Terekti
and its remarkable scenery. The River Baskau flows
between extraordinary banks, great bare rocks, all
squared and architectural in appearance, giving the
impression of immense ancient fortresses over the
stream. These squared and shelved rocks are characteristic
of the country-side and the geological formations,
and they give much grandeur to what otherwise
were quiet corners. The gateway of Abakum itself
owes its impressiveness to this geological rune.</p>

<p>At a village hereabout I fell in with four boys
going up into the mountains to study for the
summer. They were students from some large
engineering college, and, as part of their training,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
they had been sent out to study irrigation works and
bridges in this colony. At every bridge we came to
on the road they stopped and gave it their consideration,
and made notes as to its structure and its
necessities, and at each village they considered the
control of the mountain streams, the canalisation of
the water, and the uses to which the natural supplies
of water could be put. They called themselves
<i>hydrotechnics</i>, and would eventually blossom, perhaps,
into irrigation engineers. Their trip was costing
them no more than one hundred roubles&mdash;say, ten
pounds each for the three months of summer. Their
headquarters was to be a village on a river about a
hundred miles north of Lepsinsk; there they would
pitch their tents and camp, cooking their meals,
arranging expeditions, and making good their study.
Altogether about three dozen young students would
turn up at their camping-ground, and make up the
equivalent of a summer class.</p>

<p>The four young men had in their protection a
lady in cotton trousers, a tall young woman of
athletic appearance and good looks. She and her
two little children were on their way to the husband,
a Government engineer, who had charge of the
building of the new town of Lepsinsk&mdash;the nearest
railway point to Old Lepsinsk. She was a very
striking figure in her <i>sharivari</i>, and the natives
collected round her and stared in an absurd fashion.
She told me she had bought the print for 1 rouble
87 copecks, and made them herself just before starting
out; skirts were so inconvenient for travelling in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
and collected the dirt so. But she drew thereby an
enormous amount of attention to herself, it must be
said. She was rather a crazy Kate. It tickled me
to think how her husband would pitch into her when
she arrived at her destination. But perhaps I was
mistaken, and he was so homesick that he would not
even laugh when she appeared. She was a regular
scapegrace, with light blue, torn, openwork stockings,
and button boots, one of which was fastened
with a safety-pin, the other with two shirt-buttons.
But she was very na&iuml;ve and had bunches of smiles on
her lips&mdash;the sort to which much is forgiven. When
she tried to smack her children, they went for her
tooth and nail, and the little boy, aged two, continually
imitated someone, probably the father, and
addressed his mother thus:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Akh tee somnoi ne zagovarivaisia</i>&#8221; (&#8220;Don&#8217;t
stand there talking to me.&#8221;)</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Bross!</i>&#8221; (&#8220;Stop it!&#8221;)</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Pliun!</i>&#8221; (&#8220;Spit!&#8221;)</p>

<p>I was called upon to imitate cats and dogs and sheep
and pigeons and camels, and make-believe generally
to an unlimited extent.</p>

<p>The lady told an amusing story of a banquet to
which the Kirghiz had invited her husband and herself.
It should be explained that the Russian for
the head of an animal is <i>golovo</i>, and for the head of
an expedition or band of workmen is <i>glavny</i>, the
adjective derived from <i>golovo</i>, a head. At this
banquet in the Kirghiz tent the engineer was put in
the highest seat, and was told that the dinner was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
coming. Suddenly a Kirghiz appeared with a roast
sheep&#8217;s head, and carried it to the Russian, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, eat!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; asked the engineer. &#8220;The head
for me; that won&#8217;t do at all. I don&#8217;t want the
sheep&#8217;s head; you must cut me something more
tasty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, please,&#8221; said the Kirghiz. &#8220;You are the
head man, and you must eat the head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will never do,&#8221; said the Russian. But
they besought him to honour their custom and permit
the rest to eat, for until he had started on the head
nobody else might begin.</p>

<p>All the engineer&#8217;s workmen were Kirghiz, for
he was working in Kirghiz country, in a district as
yet untouched by Russian colonisation. The wife
and her babies turned off at a mountain track, and
were taken to her husband&#8217;s camping-ground by a
Kirghiz. We were loath to let the woman go, for
she had given much gaiety to the road.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Lepsinsk is what the Russians call a <i>medvezhy
ugolok</i> (a bear&#8217;s corner), a place where in winter
the wolves roam the main street as if they did not
distinguish it from their peculiar haunts. It is by
post-road 945 miles from Tashkent on the one hand,
and 1,040 miles from Omsk on the other&mdash;roughly,
1,000 miles from a railway station. It is high up on
the mountains on the Mongolian frontier, and lives
a life of its own, almost completely unaware of
what is happening in Russia and in Europe&mdash;a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
window on to Mongolia, as a local wit has
called it.</p>

<p>In the course of the next five years a railway is
to be run from Semipalatinsk to Verney, and as
Lepsinsk is the largest town on the way, it should
in justice pass through it. But Lepsinsk is high.
When the news of the projected railway came, the
burgesses made a petition to the authorities asking
to be informed where exactly the railway would be,
and they would remove Lepsinsk thither. Everyone
who had any business would transfer his stock. They
were informed, and in a year, or a year and a half,
Lepsinsk promised to remove itself fifty miles westward.
Building operations were in full swing on the
new site, land having been allowed by the Government
free; and the engineer whose wife we had met
was in charge. If the war does not preclude the
continuation of the railway construction, Old Lepsinsk
will be abandoned.</p>

<p>I spent four days in the town in the company of
the young <i>hydrotechnics</i>. We were given rooms free
at the Zemsky guest-house, and I stayed three
nights there before resuming my journey toward the
Irtish. The students quickly found and made friends
with people in the town. We found a family that
came from the same country-side as one of the young
men, and spent the whole evening in a big farmhouse,
drinking tea, trying musical instruments, and
singing Russian choruses. Next day we went to the
colonists&#8217; information office, made friends with the
young man in charge, and went and played <i>pyramid</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
with him in the town assembly rooms; several other
folk came in, young and old, and joined in the game
of billiards till we were a dozen or more. After
billiards we all sat down to a crude lunch of boiled
and undisguised beef, without vegetables, but with
jugs of creamy milk to drink. The conversation went
on cards, billiards, the coming Sunday-night dance.
Couldn&#8217;t an orchestra be made up to supplant the usual
gramophone to which the people danced on Sunday
evenings? Had the cinematograph films come, and
that had been so long expected? What would happen
if one showed a cinema film backward&mdash;wouldn&#8217;t
the story be often more funny?</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_194.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">SHEEP-SHEARING OUTSIDE THE TENT HOME</p>

<p>Sunday morning we spent in the domain of
the colonists&#8217; information bureau, and interviewed
peasants for the manager whilst he was still in bed.
What a litter there was everywhere&mdash;tea glasses,
cigarette boxes, picture post cards, electric lamps, old
letters, forms issued by the Government, maps&mdash;the
same in the bedroom as in the office. There was a
typewriter, and I amused myself trying to write
English sentences with the Russian type, there being
a fair number of letters in the Russian language
resembling our own. The people who came for
information had various pleas. One was ill, another
had quarrelled with her husband. An old man
pushed in front of him a rather downcast young
woman, and commenced his appeal to us in these
words: &#8220;I recommend this woman to your mercy.
The land which is hers is being stolen away from
her.&#8221; She had fallen out with her husband, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
had fled to her father&#8217;s house. But meanwhile the
husband was trying to sell the land or raise money
on it&mdash;at least, so the father said. But we pointed
out to him that that was nonsense; the land was not
yet the unqualified property of the husband, and he
could not sell it; he could only give it back to the
Government, and so on and so on. On Sunday
evening we all went to the assembly rooms, and saw
Lepsinsk in its Sunday best, talked vociferously in
crowds, listened to a gramophone, watched peasant
girls and young men dance melancholy waltzes&mdash;there
was no Russian dancing, but the people were glad
to think themselves &#8220;European.&#8221; I made acquaintance
with the <i>ispravnik</i>, or whoever he was who ruled
Lepsinsk, and with the local rich men&mdash;a remote,
obtuse, provincial set, whose only interest was cards.
They were very keen on playing me at <i>preference</i>,
a complex Russian card game which I have
generally thought it worth while not to learn, and I
was amused to hear that they would teach me, and
what I lost would pay for my lesson. I talked a
little about England. They got their daily papers
three weeks after issue, as a rule, but they read
them as new when they came. Their chief idea of
our British activities was that the suffragettes were
assassinating, murdering, bombing, expropriating, and
they chuckled over the fact that our men were not
able to manage the women.</p>

<p>Lepsinsk is an out-of-the-way place, and, as far
as the road is concerned, a blind alley among the
mountains. I was much exercised to know which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
way I should go next, and I did not want to retrace
my steps to Altin-Emel. The map and my route
was another topic of conversation among the worthies
of Lepsinsk. Everyone gave me a different account
of the roads and the ferries. Eventually I decided
to cut across country and take the risk of marshes
or rushing water lying in my path&mdash;a rash decision,
as I might after a day or so be forced to walk back
to the town and try some other way; but it turned
out to be a perfectly happy decision. On this track
I saw more of the Cossacks and of the Kirghiz, two
races in striking contrast, and I spent Midsummer
Night&mdash;always a festival night&mdash;under very beautiful
and unusual circumstances.</p>

<p>Lepsinsk is a Cossack settlement. All the young
men are horsemen, have to serve their term in war,
and are liable to military service without any exemption
or exception. All Cossack families and Cossack
villages are brought up on these terms. The children
are taught to get on to horseback and ride as we
teach our children to walk. They learn the songs
which the regiment sings as it comes up the main
street on horseback, bearing the black pikes in their
hands. The women, whose children and husbands
go to the war, are patient as the mother of Taress
Bulba. War is the normal condition of life, and
the mere man&#339;uvres are taken so seriously that the
opposing parties frequently forget that it is only a
friendly test, and do one another serious injury.
&#8220;The Cossacks get so enraged, and they can&#8217;t
stop themselves when they are called upon to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
charge the sham enemy,&#8221; said a Lepsinsk boy
to me.</p>

<p>On the Monday morning I said good-bye to the
students, and, shouldering my knapsack, set off in a
north-westerly direction to find Sergiopol, forded the
Lepsa river, and climbed out of the green valley
where Lepsinsk lies as in a cup. The mountain-sides
were rankly verdant, and the purple labiate was thick
as in spring-time. It may be remarked that strawberries
were not expected to ripen in Lepsinsk for
three weeks, whereas six weeks ago in Tashkent they
had been a penny a pound.</p>

<p>I passed over the fresh green hills and panted
at the gradient, plunged down through beautiful
meadows, slept a night in the Cossack station of
Cherkask, lying on some felt and being almost eaten
up by mosquitoes in what the soldier host called a
garden. In this village I saw a pitiful sight&mdash;almost
naked Kirghiz women treading wet mud and manure
into stuff for fuel blocks. They looked astonishingly
bestial and degraded. You could not feel that they
had any soul or stood in any way above the animals.
Yet as young women they had probably been attractive
and pretty in their day, and might even have
won the fancy of white men. There was a question
whether the wife in <i>Candida</i> who soiled her lovely
fingers putting kerosene into the lamps was really
degraded by dirt, but here was something nearer
reality.</p>

<p>I slept on the sand beside Gregoriefsky, and next
day went deep into the desert, into a land of snakes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
eagles, snipe, and lizards. On the Lepsa shore I
saw forests of the gigantic reeds with which the
houses and bridges are roofed. Here were leagues
of ten-feet rushes that waved boisterously in the
wind as in a cinema picture. I was warned here
against the boa-constrictor; but the worst I saw were
intent-eyed little snakes gliding away from me, scared
at the sound of the footfall. I got my noon-day meal
of koumis in a Kirghiz <i>yurt</i>, borrowed a horse with
which to get across the difficult fords, one of black,
reed-grown mud, the other of swift-flowing water.
All day I ploughed through ankle-deep sand, and but
for the fact that the sun was obscured by cloud, I
should have suffered much from heat. As it was, the
dust and sand-laden wind was very trying. Early in
the evening I resolved to stop for the day, and found
shelter in one of twenty tents all pitched beside one
another in a pleasant green pasture-land which lay
between two bends of the river&mdash;a veritable oasis.
Even here, as I sat in the tent, I listened to the
constant sifting of the sand on the felt sides and
roof.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_198.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">IN SUMMER PASTURE: EVENING OUTSIDE THE KIRGHIZ TENT</p>

<p>It was a good resting-place. An old man spread
for me carpets and rugs, and bade me sleep, and I
lay down for an hour, the sand settling on me all
the time, and blowing into my eyes and my ears and
my lips. In the meantime tea was made for me
from some chips of Mongolian brick tea. The old
Kirghiz took a black block of this solidified tea dust
and cut it with an old razor. The samovar was an
original one. It had no tap, and leaked as fast as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
would pour. Consequently, a bowl was set underneath
to catch the drip. This filled five or six times
before boiling-point was reached, the contents of the
bowl being each time returned to the body of the
samovar.</p>

<p>After tea I went out and sat on a mound among
the cattle, and watched the children drive in sheep
and goats and cows, and the wives milk them all.
It was a scene of gaiety and beauty. There were
many good-looking wives, slender and dainty, though
they were so short in stature, had white turbans on
their heads and jackboots on their feet. As they
went to and fro, laughing among themselves and
bending over the cattle, their breasts hanging like
large full pears at the holes made in their cotton
clothes for the convenience of their babies, they
looked a very gentle and innocent creation. These
women did all the work of milking, and I saw them
handle with rapidity ewes, she-goats, cows, mares,
draining all except the last into common receptacles.
The mares&#8217; milk alone was kept separate, to be made
into koumis. I must say my taste rebelled against
a mixture of sheep&#8217;s milk, goats&#8217; milk and cows&#8217;
milk, even when made sour; but the Kirghiz were
not worried with such fastidiousness.</p>

<p>When the milking was accomplished fires were lit
in oblong holes dug in the earth outside the tents&mdash;the
Kirghiz stoves. Bits of mutton were cut up and
fixed on skewers and placed over the glowing ashes
in the holes. So supper was cooked. I was called
into a tent, and there made to sit on a high wooden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
trunk, while eight or ten others sat below me on
rugs. &#8220;You are a <i>barin</i>,&#8221; said the oldest man.
&#8220;You must have the highest seat.&#8221; Seated up
there, they brought me about a dozen skewers of
grilled mutton on a wooden plate and bade
me eat. I should not have been surprised to see a
sheep&#8217;s head brought in to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; I said, &#8220;it&#8217;s far too much for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You eat first,&#8221; said the old man. &#8220;Then we
will eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>So I took a skewer and put them at their ease.
There were in the tent the old man, his son, two
wives of the latter, several children, an old woman,
and a minstrel. Outside and in other tents were
many sons-in-law and daughters-in-law and cousins,
a whole genealogical tree of a family. Among the
Kirghiz all sons remain in the father&#8217;s and father&#8217;s
father&#8217;s family; only the girls change families, sold
or arranged for in marriage. The men all wore hats,
or, rather, bonnets, trimmed with an edging of fox&#8217;s
fur, and the foxes from whose thighs this fur had
been taken had been captured by trained eagles.
The Kirghiz are deeply versed in falconry, and have
diverse birds for various preys: hawks for cranes,
for plovers, and for hares. They hunt the fox,
whose skin is very precious, with eagles. They carry
the hawks on their wrists when they ride, and for
the support of heavy birds they have stalls or rests
coming up from their saddles to hold the bird arm,
whilst they hold the horse&#8217;s reins with the other.
The most interesting man in the tent in which I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
supped was the minstrel, a tall, gaunt heathen in
ragged cotton slops; he thrummed on a two-stringed
guitar and improvised Kirghiz songs till the dusk
grew dark and midsummer night came out with
countless stars over the desert and the tents and the
cattle and the wanderers.</p>

<p>Asked whether I would sleep inside the tent or
out, I preferred the open air, and my hosts made a
couch for me, a pile of rugs over an uneven thickness
of mown clover. And there I lay and watched
the stars come into their places in the sky as at the
lifting of a conductor&#8217;s baton. It was St. John&#8217;s
Eve, a night of mystery and of remembrances. A
young moon looked down on me. In the twenty
tents around me were singing and music and
momentary strange illuminations. Inside the tents
the Kirghiz set fire every now and then to piles of
weeds, which flared up, causing all the felt walls and
roofs of the tents to glow like strange, enormous,
shimmering paper lanterns, like fire reflected in
silver. They would suddenly glimmer and glow and
glimmer again, the light would go, and the grey-white
tent would be opaque again.</p>

<p>All night across the sleeping encampment came
volumes of music from young throats, the songs of
the children minding the cattle. The stillness of the
night reigned about this music, and was intensified
by the <i>dun-dun</i> of rusty camel-bells, the jangle of
the irons on hobbled horses, the occasional sneeze of
a sheep with a cold, and the hullabaloo of dogs
barking on false alarms. I lay and was nibbled under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
by goats, trying to get at the clover, and breathed at
by ruminating cows.</p>

<p>So the night passed. Orion chased the Pleiades
across the sky. The eyes that stared or lay open
and were stared at by the stars drooped, and eyelids
came down over the little windows. Sprites danced
among us, tiptoed where we slept, breathed devilry
upon our faces and dusty clothes, and I dreamed
sweetly of home and other days.</p>

<p>Next morning I felt the turn of the year and
looked forward to the glorious autumn and the new
life coming after the long journey and the much
tramping.</p>

<p>I was up at the dawning and away before the
hot sun rose. The old man of the Kirghiz gave me
my breakfast himself, a pot of <i>airann</i> and a cake of
<i>lepeshka</i>, and came forward with me, showing me
the track onward towards Sergiopol.</p>

<small>OVER THE SIBERIAN BORDER</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;CROSSED the Lepsa by a bridge made of old
herring barrels, struck the highway to Sergiopol
at Romanovskaya, and pursued my journey along
the sandy wastes and salt swamps on the eastern
borders of Lake Balkhash. The Lepsa falls into this
great lake at last. The wind blew up the sand so
that there was some chance of missing the way, and
I sat some hours on my knapsack and shut my eyes
to keep the sand out. It was dreary country, yellow
and inhospitable. The odour of the bleached grasses
and herbs was almost overpowering, and food and
palatable water were far to seek. Tall, bleached and
withered grasses and white weeds and dust-laden,
knobbly steppe; wind and racing sand&mdash;sand in my
eyes, in my mouth, on my body&mdash;I felt a most
despicable creature, and questioned my sanity in ever
starting out on such an absurd journey as this
through Russian Central Asia. But I saw ahead of
me Sergiopol, Semipalatinsk, and a happier clime.
Sixty versts north of Romanovskaya the road,
gradually ascending a long moor, entered broken
country through black and rusty mountainettes, and
here was a little crooked gorge with a stream through
it, and it was possible to sit by my own little fire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
and make tea for myself once more. Then more
moorland, and heavily scented grass, and enormous
bustards, the size of goats, and skinny little brown
marmots, and withered mullein stalks, and comical
blue jackdaws perching on them and cocking their
heads to one side and peering at me as I passed.
Then streams of colonists and their carts. Then an
official and his wife, sleeping in their night attire in
their slowly moving <i>tarantass</i>, huge pillows for their
heads, and sheets and quilts and what not&mdash;an
example of the Russians&#8217; gift for making themselves
at home. Near Ince-Agatch I met two
Germans going cheerfully along on foot&mdash;as I was&mdash;a
botanist and a geologist, neither of them speaking
Russian, but feeling pretty well as much at home as
in Germany, more so, perhaps. One wonders what
was their fortune at the outbreak of war. There are
certain international pursuits that know no restriction
of national or imperial ground. I do not
suppose the Russian grudges the German making a
study of his flowers and rocks&mdash;if he is not spying
at the same time. Probably we ought not to lay so
much stress on purely national research in ornithology,
entomology, geology, botany, the ways of
peoples, and so forth. Individuals and their work
are dedicated to their nation and their empire, but
that should not keep our practical scientists, collectors,
prospectors, students to a mere portion of the
surface of the globe. Russian Central Asia and
Siberia claims greater attention from our scientific
men, hunters, and expert collectors. Russians, on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
whole, do little; Germans have done something; but
it does not matter by whom it is explored, there lies
here a vast natural field for the study of mankind.
These domains are scarcely touched, except by vulgar
gold hunters and rock tappers&mdash;people of paltry greed
and little imagination. The great era of research
has not even begun, and libraries of books have yet
to be written on the natural wonders and astonishing
discoveries to be found and made in this wilder and
more neglected half of Asia. After the war Siberia
and Russian Central Asia will begin to draw more
attention from us.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_204.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">FOUR WIVES OF A RICH KIRGHIZ</p>

<p>Sergiopol, the last point in Seven Rivers Land
before entering Siberia, is a beautifully situated
diminutive town, or, rather, village, for it has been
degraded from the rank of town. The hills and
moors around it are beautiful virgin country, bathed
in pleasant sunshine and breathing healthful air; but
in itself it is but a miserable place, a collection of
wee grocer-shops and cotton stores. The shopkeepers
are mostly Tartars, doing very small trade and thinking
it very large and feeling &#8220;passing rich.&#8221; The
vendors of cotton goods do the most trade, for all
the Kirghiz wear cotton and give a great deal of
consideration to the purchase of it. I met a commercial
traveller smoking a cigarette in the market-place,
a man sent out by one of the great cotton
firms of Moscow, and he was carrying bags of
samples to all the stores of Seven Rivers Land.
The Tartars took so long to decide what they were
going to buy that the traveller was reduced to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
novel procedure. Directly he arrived at a settlement
he took from his chest eight bags of samples, and
went rapidly from one shop to another, leaving a
bag at each, and saying he would return in an hour
and a half. Then he went into the market-place and
had a smoke and chat with chance comers. If there
were more than eight shops he had a second round,
and distributed the bags to the remainder after the
first set had come to a decision. Not a very good
way of doing business, one would think; but, then,
the Tartars spoke in their own language, consulted
their wives about materials and colours, and liked to
be free of the presence of the Russian. He did
quite a good business. He told me that his cotton
goods found a large market in China. The Chinese
and the Kirghiz were extremely critical as to the
quality of the cotton and the colour and design. You
could not palm off shoddy cotton on these people.
It was their Sunday best as well as week-day, and
their outer garment as much and more than undergarment.
Its quality and appearance mattered.
Neither German cotton nor their own Lodz manufacture
was any use. Lodz is the great centre for
the production of shoddy cotton&mdash;so much so that
the adjective Lodzinsky is a Russian colloquialism for
shoddy, and when you say <i>Lodzinsky tovar</i> it is more
than when we say &#8220;a bit of Brummagem.&#8221; Moscow,
however, produces good qualities of cotton and good
prints. Manchester has dropped behind Moscow in
this respect and tended to compete rather with Lodz.
Perhaps after the war we shall solve this passion for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
cheapness, this competition with Germany in turning
out <i>cheap</i> wares, and will revert to our earlier
prejudice in favour of British quality. It is rather
touching in Russia that best quality goods are often
called <i>Anglisky tovar</i> (English wares), even when
made in Russia. Our reputation for thoroughness
survives.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_206.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">AT A KIRGHIZ FUNERAL</p>

<p>Still, I do not suppose that Great Britain will
ever compete with Russia in the supply of cotton to
the interior. Russians and English living in Russia
have imported our British machinery and set up mills
which are really British mills on Russian soil, and an
enormous business has been founded. Russia, moreover,
hopes to be able to grow enough raw cotton in
her Central Asian dominions to be able to make her
cotton business a national self-dependent industry.
Cotton is the material mostly used for clothing in
Russia, even in the towns. The women are still
content with cotton dresses and the men with cotton
blouses. When cloth and &#8220;stuff&#8221; come in, if they
ever do, the cotton industry will tend to degenerate,
but not till then.</p>

<p>Sergiopol is a place of little significance. But
the next town, Semipalatinsk, in Siberia, is a large
colonial town, with over 35,000 inhabitants&mdash;larger,
even, than Verney. But Siberia is an old-established
Russian colony, while Seven Rivers began only fifty
years ago, and was a desert. Perhaps even now it is
little more than a desert qualified by irrigation. The
obstacles in the way of successful settlement have
been tremendous. Still, these obstacles are being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
overcome. The result of half a century&#8217;s work is a
measure of clear success and a healthy promise.
Hundreds of Russian villages have established themselves,
and the channels of small trade have been
kept open. Yellow deserts have become green with
verdure, and chains of oases have been made.
Russian schools and Russian churches have arisen on
the northern side of India, and an essentially
Christian culture is spreading in a way that is clearly
profitable to the Old World. The colony sadly needs
a railway, and the railway is being built quickly,
even now, in the time of the war. For the Kirghiz,
who do most of the labour, are not required for
military service. When the railway comes, more
people will come with it, more colonists, more
traders, and they will take away the products which
the farmers would gladly sell. We are accustomed
to think of railways spoiling districts, but Russian
Central Asia, with its empty leagues of sand and
barrenness, will only profit by the railway. The railway
must go east from Tashkent all the way to
Verney, and probably as far as Kuldja, in China,
then northward, through Iliisk and Sergiopol, to
Semipalatinsk, through Siberian farms and settlements,
forests and marshes, to the Siberian main
line at Omsk. This will greatly strengthen the
Russian Empire when it is achieved. It will be a
wise measure of consolidation.</p>

<p>M. de Vesselitsky, in his able book on Russia,
remarks that whereas in 1906 the population of
Canada was greater than that of Siberia, in 1911<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
Siberia had two million more inhabitants. This is
the more astonishing because Canada has splendid and
populous towns, whereas Siberia has only three cities
of over a hundred thousand inhabitants. A strange
contrast to European Russia, this Asiatic Russia; no
Court, no Emperor, no aristocracy, no modern aims
or claims, no power&mdash;in a sense, human tundra and
taiga, though many millions are living there. Then
a power enters it, commercial capital and the Russian
desire to get rich, and Siberia begins to seek new
wealth. European Russia and the dazzling if somewhat
tawdry West begins to hear of the wealth of
Siberia. Our civilisation, the centre of attraction,
draws from all the outside wilds and wildernesses
gold, precious stones, skins. So we help Siberia in
the material sense and set its industrial life a-going.</p>

<small>ON THE IRTISH</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE most interesting circumstance in the
history of Semipalatinsk up till now is that
Dostoieffsky, in exile, was domiciled there. The cities
dotting the wastes of Siberia are not notable. They
are young, and things have not happened in them.
But dreary Semipalatinsk held the mightiest spirit in
modern Russia&mdash;Fedor Dostoieffsky, the author of
&#8220;The Brothers Karamazof.&#8221; So Semipalatinsk, on
the loose sands of the River Irtish, has now its
Dostoieffsky house, where Dostoieffsky lived, and a
Dostoieffsky street. It will, no doubt, be a place of
pilgrimage in the future for those wishing to grasp
the significance of the great Russian.</p>

<p>Semipalatinsk is a dull collection of wooden
houses and stores, an important trading centre
functionising an immense country-side. What struck
me most were the large general shops, with their
extensive supplies of manufactured goods and all
manner of luxuries. There were at least six department
stores, with handsome clocks, vases, bedroom
furniture, mandolins, violins, guitars, Vienna boots,
American boots, gay hats, silk dresses, wrapped
chocolates, promiscuous and lavish supplies of all
manner of European goods. English wares seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
noticeable chiefly by their absence, and the cutlery
was Swedish, the stoves Austrian, the wools and the
cottons Russian, the note-paper American or French,
the wonderful enamel ware and nickel and aluminium
ware German. Only sanitary contrivances, cream
separators, and agricultural machinery seemed to be
English. How much more of these things might
be sent. However, with all these signs of luxury&mdash;luxury
for Russians&mdash;Semipalatinsk lacks the graces
of a town; has no lighting, no pavement or public
place, no theatre, only a cinema. Its prospect is
waste, loose sand, which the air holds even in calm&mdash;a
grit in the eyes and in the mouth. Its trees do
not flourish, and only people accustomed to a quiet
life could go on living there from year to year. The
peasants bring most life into the town, selling their
products in the immense open market, or buying
manufactured goods to take up-country to their
farms. The broad River Irtish flows placidly onward,
five hundred miles to Omsk and thousands of miles to
the Arctic Ocean, and it is navigated by a considerable
number of steamers and sailing boats. It is a
great waterway&mdash;a sort of safer sea in the heart of Asia.
The wonder is that more towns have not sprung up
on its shores. In the history of the world it has not
yet become a typical river. It flows from the silences
of the Altai mountains, through the silences of
Northern Asia, the noise of man hardly ever becoming
more than a whisper upon it. It never becomes</p>

<p>It is almost as peaceful and serene as a river in an
undiscovered continent.</p>

<p>At Semipalatinsk I stayed some days before
taking boat up-stream to Malo-Krasnoyarsk. It was
here that I read of the astonishing intelligence of the
assassination of the Archduke of Austria and his
wife. The Russian papers of the time devoted a
great deal of space to the details of the murder, the
reprisals taken by the Austrians, the gossip of
Europe. The preoccupation of the British Press
with home affairs was astonishing, and in all the
telegraphed opinions of our representative papers
there was not an utterance that overstepped the
limits of conventionality. Whether the murder was
planned politically by Germany, as has been hinted,
or planned politically by Serbia for vengeance, or
came about accidentally through the passion of a
noble Serb, it was in any case a test phenomenon.
It had enormous significance to diplomatists and
scanners of political horizons. By the attitude and
behaviour of Germany and Austria their intentions,
at least in the Near East, could be gauged. But it
did not seem of sufficient importance to conscious
England. The Austrians tried to spread the idea
that Russia had contrived and bought the murder of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
the Archduke because she feared his intentions in the
Balkans. But, out of the Germanic dominions, that
did not carry weight. Austria manifestly threatened
Serbia politically, and some British people scratched
their heads and asked questions: &#8220;Shall we go to
war for Serbia?&#8221; Then came the seemingly obvious
answer: &#8220;No, not for <i>Serbia</i>!&#8221; which fairly indicates
the blindness of that part of England which was
vocal at that time. In that spirit we neglected our
duty in connection with the St. James&#8217;s conference
after the first Balkan war, and in that spirit we
alienated Bulgaria in the great European war which
followed.</p>

<p>Austria threatened war, and there was clearly
the prospect of Austria and Russia fighting. I
weighed it up in my mind as I waited at Semipalatinsk,
and more than once I asked myself whether
I had not better give up my journey onward and go
straight to Western Russia. But, deciding I did not
want to write war correspondence, I concluded I
would continue my way, and rest as I had intended&mdash;on
the verdant Altai. So I left Semipalatinsk and
went in a little steamer up the narrowing and rocky
river, past wooded islands, grey moors, and emerald
marshes. It was a long though not monotonous river
journey. We stopped at elementary wooden landing-stages
beside small hamlets, bought eggs, fish, fruit
from peasant women and children, backed out into
midstream again, making our big wave that went
washing along the banks and drenching incautious
boys and girls; we beat up the water with our paddle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
turned, saw ourselves clear of the pier, and a widening
stretch of water between us and the bank, found
our course between the buoys, avoided the weirs and
the shallows. Morning became hot noon, and the
afternoon and twilight time came on, and then
luminous starry night, and again morning and hot
noon. We stopped at the little town of Ust-Kamennygorsk,
the headquarters for several mining
camps, a bit of qualified civilisation not unknown
to British mining engineers. We had on board a
couple of priests, a commercial traveller, some workmen
coming back from doing a job, and two dozen
raw Cossacks who had been ordered to serve on the
Chinese frontier&mdash;rather interesting to reflect now
how they were travelling away from the place where
they would be needed. At that time all the preparations
for war were going on apace in Germany; the
roads were full of horses newly bought by the
Government, the trains full of stores; at the military
camps the last man&#339;uvres were being worked out
with full regiments and the complete panoply of
war. We in the steamboat were all travelling the
wrong way, away from the interest of the world&mdash;the
centre&mdash;up-stream on the fast-flowing river, against
the currents and the tendencies. A month later all
would come back, forced by the declaration of war.
Still, little we recked. We had a holiday spirit.
There were several high-school girls and girl students
on board&mdash;<i>gimnasistki</i> and <i>kursistki</i>&mdash;and the deck
was vocal with their chattering and laughing. They
were a charming contrast to rough Siberia. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
deck passengers drank vodka and sang. Down below
deck was a public stove, and there sizzled a score
of pots&mdash;pots with jam, with eggs, with fish, with
chickens, with milk. I made my coffee there, and
would frequently see it rising at the boil and be
unable to pick the pot out for others tending their
fish-soup and women taking the scum off their
strawberry jam. At each little village people bought
things to cook, so that at times you might have
thought it was a sort of cooking expedition.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_214.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">KIRGHIZ PRAYING</p>

<p>So we went on at this momentous time in
history. The river became more rapid and difficult
to navigate; it serpentined through wild gorges,
where the rocks were broken and ragged and squared
and angular. The steep cliffs were full of detail that
was delicious to the eye. Where the cliffs were not
so steep Nature had clothed their nakedness with
mould and grass. We passed from placid stretches
which seemed to throw the rays of the sun back on
the ship, the people and the sky, and we entered the
intense cold shadow of high, sheer rocks. The water
became green and shadowy. The scenery changed
every moment as we went round a new bend of the
river and entered new territory through forbidding
gates of rock. Frequently we found ourselves in
foaming cauldrons from which there seemed to be no
exit; we wandered round, travelling as often north
as south, and catching glimpses of sun from all
imaginable quarters, and found loopholes of escape
to new reaches. The steamer seemed a toy beside the
huge cliffs on each side, and the sunshine, when we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
came into it, seemed sufficient to blind the whole
Altai. The higher we pursued our winding way the
higher became the cliffs, till eventually we had grey
crags of several hundred feet hanging over us. In
the earlier gorges the greenness of the vegetation of
the hills was reflected in the river in a deep, shadowy
green, but in the later ones the drear greyness of the
cliffs was alone reflected, and the swift-moving, placid
water looked like oil. As far as Gusinaya Pristan
trees&mdash;birches&mdash;but infrequent ones, and growing in
haphazard ways from clefts in rocks. Besides our
panting, puffing steamer, with its streamer of dense
smoke and persistent showers of sparks, there were
only rafts on the river&mdash;logs roped together, and
peasants standing on the water-washed floating platforms.
They seemed to be very skilful in managing
them. On the banks we saw occasional tents and
fishermen&#8217;s tackle, small fires with tripods over
them, and old black pots whereby you guessed that
fish were cooking. Occasional hay-making parties
also visible on the wan outskirts of farms. It was a
fascinating journey, and one could not take one&#8217;s
eyes from the changing scene, the prospect from door
after door as we passed new rocks, the delicious side
views, the clefts and wounds healed with birch trees
and greenery, the battered, jaggy prominences, dull
blue, purple, yellow with age and many weathers.</p>

<p>Everyone watched curiously for the next scene,
and the change was so frequent that no one got
tired. Mountains, ridges&mdash;the grandeur of our rock
basins multiplied upon us so that we felt we were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
steadily ascending a high mountain range by river.
Night was wonderful, especially when we stopped to
put some cargo off or to take on wood, and we got
out and walked on the cliffs and the sand; the stars
in the sky had their drips of golden reflection in the
river, and the opposite banks and rocks were majestically
silhouetted against the sky. The navigation of
this river is, perhaps, one of the sights of the future.
&#8220;Parties will be taken out.&#8221; But there is no
romance there, no castles, no ruins&mdash;only Nature and
the grey tumultuous misery and beauty of a scarred
continent.</p>

<small>THE COUNTRY OF THE MARAL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MALO-KRASNOYARSK, on the Irtish, is a
hot, sandy village supporting itself by agriculture,
fishing, and melon growing. It is treeless,
no one seeming to have cared to plant the trees
which could so easily have been grown, and the
native Kirghiz are employed making fuel blocks out
of manure. The stacks of these black blocks give an
unpleasant odour when the wind is blowing over
them. Otherwise, the Irtish is rather wonderful&mdash;deep
and green and swift, with powerful currents.</p>

<p>From Malo-Krasnoyarsk I journeyed along the
burnt road and over the vast stretches of pungent
wormwood that grow on the moors. The road
climbed to the mountain ridges of the Narimsky
range, and along them to the Central Altai. I had
given up tramping now, and an old man in a dirty
crimson blouse drove me in a cart to Bozhe-Narimsky
village, took me for three shillings, and was ready
to drive me to Kosh Agatch, on the other side of
the mountains, if I would say but the word. Kosh
Agatch, according to his reckoning, would be five
hundred miles, and he would have to plan a month&#8217;s
journey over the mountains, hire extra horses, and
buy provisions. According to him traders made the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
journey frequently, especially Tartars and Chinamen,
buying maral horns.</p>

<p>On the higher slopes of the Altai the sale of the
horns of the maral deer (<i>Cervus canadensis asiaticus</i>)
seems to be, if not the chief, at least the most
picturesque means of earning a livelihood. I was
making my way into the maral country. Here the
colonists, instead of farming sheep and cows, farm a
species of deer with very valuable horns&mdash;the maral.
The horns are not valuable as ornaments, or as bone,
or as drinking vessels, but as medicine. A very
curious trade. The Russians cut off the horns of
the deer every spring, boil them, dry them, and sell
them into China, where they sell at the rate of
about a shilling an ounce, and give almost miraculous
relief to women in the pains of childbirth, make it
possible for barren women to have children, and many
other things.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it good for that purpose?&#8221; I asked of the
man who was driving me.</p>

<p>&#8220;They say so,&#8221; said he, without committing
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;But do Russian women use this medicine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; it&#8217;s too expensive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But do they believe in it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they don&#8217;t need it. They are not like the
Kitankas and Mongolians, who suffer very much.
These Chinawomen are like the camels here. The
camels would die out if it were not for the skill
the Kirghiz women have in making them breed.
They would die out, but the Kirghiz keep them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
going. The same with the Chinawomen; they need
the powder of the maral horn. No Chinawoman of
any importance thinks of marrying without a pair of
maral horns in her possession, and if her father be
too poor to purchase them, the husband must. They
all use it, and you can buy the powder in any
chemist&#8217;s shop in China.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or an imitation?&#8221; I suggested.</p>

<p>My driver could not say whether the substance
could be imitated. Later on, on my journey, I saw
marals, both on the run and in the immense maral
gardens which the Russians keep in their colony.</p>

<p>Bozhe-Narimsky was a pleasant green corner,
with tumbling river, many willow trees, mosquitoes,
marshes. Thence the road went higher and higher to
Maly Narimsky and Tulovka, through districts where
once were forests of great pines and now are only
forests of stumps, through wildernesses of pink
mallow and purple larkspur, and over vast, swelling
uplands covered with verdure, finally to within sight
of gleaming streaks of snow and ice, the glaciers of
the central range. Bozhe-Narimsky, Maly Narimsky,
Tulovka, Medvedka, Altaiskaya, Katun-Karagai were
the names of the Russian villages and Cossack stations
on the way up. Most of them were well-established
settlements, for this territory is Siberia, and not what
is called Russian Central Asia. It has been in
Russian hands a long while, and only the fact that
Russia is so vast, and there is so much room for the
overflow of population, explains the backwardness of
the colonisation of the Altai. Russia has never had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
any enemies worth the name here, and has very little
to fear unless the Chinese ever turn bellicose. The
only people who stood in her way were the mild
nomads, the Kalmeeks and the Kirghiz. These had
unrecognised rights to certain valleys, springs, winter
pastures, summer pastures, and they walled off their
discoveries with stones and boulders, never dreaming
anyone would think of annexing them. But when
the Russian generals came riding down the valleys
with their engineers, saying, &#8220;Fix me a village here
and a village there, and give us twenty villages along
the length of that valley,&#8221; no Kirghiz or Kalmeek
had the spirit to say nay, and with a melancholy
smile they crept away, leaving the fields to those who
must take them.</p>

<p>Near Tulovka I saw the first marals, six speedy
deer running ahead of as many horsemen, just outrunning
their horses, but not disposed to race out of
sight and get lost. The horsemen, who were
Cossacks, carried lassos in their hands, and I rather
wondered why they did not shoot the deer and have
done with their hunting. A villager put me right,
however.</p>

<p>&#8220;These are not wild deer, but escaped ones,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;There are no wild deer left; they have all
been caught now. No one has seen a wild maral for
fifteen years. They have all been caught and put in
gardens, and now we breed them. If they shoot
these marals they lose six good breeders. A buck
maral is worth two hundred roubles. It&#8217;s a sad day
for the man who has lost these. It is very difficult<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
to catch them, they are very crafty; and then one
doesn&#8217;t want to injure their horns in taking them.
They generally have to ride them down until they
are dead beat; no use frightening them; just keep
them on the move and give them no rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>At Medvedka I stayed with an old man who kept
a maral farm. My host was a comical fellow, somewhat
over six feet high, with long hair, bushy beard,
kind and gentle eyes&mdash;a giant&#8217;s shoulders, an ogre&#8217;s
stomach, but the walk and manners of a child. His
great pine log house had a threshold so large that
you might almost call it a veranda but that peasants
do not have verandas. There were steps up to it,
and then a long covered way, one side of which was
the log wall of the house, in which peeped wee glass
windows; the other side was a solid little railing,
where you could lean and watch the pigs, the turkeys,
the geese, the horses and dogs in the big farm-bounded
farmyard. Beyond the yard and the pasture
stretched upward the voluminous and irregular mountain-side,
deep in a tangle of shadowy undergrowth
and made majestical by mighty firs. The gloom and
splendour of the mountains brooded over the big
log house.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_222.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">IN THE ALTAI: KIRGHIZ TOMBS NEAR MEDVEDKA</p>

<p>On the veranda were a whole series of green,
many-branching antlers just sawn away from heads of
marals&mdash;an unusual sight in any cottage. They were
velvety and hairy; if you touched them you found
them soft. Not the antlers hunters bring home and
hang on their walls, nothing hard or sharp or fearsome,
but gentle, rounded and smooth-knobbed, unripened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
antlers, sawn off from a stag&#8217;s head with a
saw.</p>

<p>Mikhail Nikanorovitch, mine host, took me up to
his maral farm, a tract of mountain-side many acres
in extent, fenced in by a gigantic paling, the posts
of which were eight or nine feet high and very solid.
The maral is a magnificent jumper, and has been
known to clear eight feet upon occasion and get
away. As the farmer has to buy the posts from the
Government, the construction of a <i>maralnik</i>, as they
call it, is not without considerable expense for the
peasants. Quite a small place would cost two hundred
roubles.</p>

<p>Mikhail and I stumped up the mountain-side
quite a height till we came to his wild enclosure.
Mine host called the deer as his peasant wife might
have called chickens to their food, and they came
fluttering towards him to be fed, but, spying me,
stopped short, sniffed the air, then turned and fled to
the wildernesses of their prison.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the summer they are in this big place,&#8221; said
Mikhail, &#8220;but in late autumn, before the snows, we
drive them into a smaller place, and we feed them
there all the winter. It is in this smaller place that
we saw off the horns in the early summer.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took me along to the shed where the horns
were sawn off.</p>

<p>&#8220;We make the first cutting only when the calf
has reached its third year. We cut off the horns in
June and the beginning of July&mdash;when the antlers
are most developed and so worth most. If we leave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
them later they harden and are no use. They would
then have to be allowed to bear their horns till next
spring, when in any case they shed them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What happens to those who have had their
antlers sawn off; do they shed the stumps?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, they shed their stumps. That is in April
or May; and then they change their coats and are
generally in a bad state of health.&#8221;</p>

<p>He described how they managed the animal
during the sawing business: put its fore-legs in a
noose, its hind-legs in a noose, threw it on the
ground, bandaged the eyes, someone carefully holding
the head and saving the horns from damage all the
time. They sawed off the horn with an ordinary
hand-saw&mdash;such a one was lying on a sort of bench
in the shed to which the old fellow had led me&mdash;and
when the sawing was done they stopped the bleeding
with coaldust and salt, and then tied up the stump
tightly with linen. The blood soon stops flowing,
and the maral, being put at liberty, forgets and
scarce knows what he has lost. In their tamed state
the deer have found a sort of alternative destiny, and
the peasants say that often marals which escape in the
summer come back voluntarily to the enclosures for
food and shelter in winter-time. Still, some do finally
disappear, and although the villager I met earlier was
of opinion that all the marals had been caught, there
must still be many thousands at large upon the vast
and unexplored Altai. In their wild state they are
extremely shy of human beings, and seemingly with
good reason.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>Old Mikhail, who was a kind of three-storied
man, pottered about, stooping the whole length of
his huge body to pick wild strawberries and raspberries,
and he constantly called out to me to help
myself to fruit. When we got back to the farmhouse
I found his wife boiling a chicken for me in a
pail over a bonfire in the garden.</p>

<p>Mikhail showed me where they boiled the horns,
and explained the process of preservation. There
were enormous coppers for the boiling. The horns
were put into boiling brine, just dipped in and taken
out several times. The difficulty was to immerse
them and yet not touch the metal sides of the pots.
If the sides were touched the delicate skin might
easily be frayed. After the immersion the horns were
exposed in the open air. They dried fairly rapidly,
and lost weight; by the time they would be ready for
sale they would have lost half their original weight.
In the late summer and autumn Chinese and Tartar
merchants appeared and made great deals in maral
horns throughout the whole district. In China the
substance of the horn is known as <i>ludzon</i>.</p>

<p>Mikhail was an extraordinarily hospitable type of
peasant, and heaped plenty on the table that evening&mdash;a
great crust of honeycomb, for he kept his
own bees and possessed a hill-side dotted with white
hives; wooden basins full of berries; butter&mdash;and
butter is rare enough in peasants&#8217; houses; and soup
and chicken and white bannocks. We had an amusing
talk about England. He had never seen a train,
the sea, an Englishman, or a German or a Frenchman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
or, indeed, any race but Russian, Kirghiz,
Chinamen, Tartars, Kalmeeks. We compared the
prices of things, and he was greatly alarmed at the
cost of meat in England. I made him wonder
more and more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, for instance, a hare,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I do not
suppose they cost much here, but in our country we
pay six or seven shillings for one at Christmas.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mikhail was astonished.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, for the skin?&#8221; asked he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no; we don&#8217;t value the skin&mdash;throw it
away or sell it to the rag-and-bone man for twopence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to say you pay that for a hare.
Now, here we keep the skin to sell and throw away
the flesh. It&#8217;s good enough for hogs. I never
thought of a hare having a price as food. I don&#8217;t
know that I could say what was the price of hare&#8217;s
flesh here. We throw it away.&#8221;</p>

<p>He played with the idea, and then eventually
inquired of me whether it were possible to get an
iced freight-truck from Omsk to London, and what
would it cost.</p>

<p>I could not say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Mikhail, &#8220;supposing we put a
nominal price of two copecks (a halfpenny) a hare
exported from here, we could make a big profit, and
it seems to me they could be got to London, and
there would be a big profit for every one concerned.&#8221;</p>

<p>I promised to give the matter my consideration,
and he was so much in earnest that, despite the fact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
he had never seen a train and could neither read nor
write, he made me note his address carefully and
take it to England, where I could give it to a
<i>commersant</i>, and he would contrive matters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell him,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that we can let him have
ten hares for a rouble. Good night.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was getting ready to lie down. Some overcoats
had been spread on the floor for me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell him there&#8217;s no end to the number of hares
to be had here. Good night,&#8221; said he again.</p>

<p>And after I had lain down he came to me again
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you comfortable? There was a man here
once who made his fortune exporting <i>sarka</i> skins.
Good night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Next morning he gave me a large metal pot of
honey and black currants mixed, as a present, and he
drove me to Altaiskaya Stanista, the top of the
Altai, himself.</p>

<small>THE DECLARATION OF WAR</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT is a fine mountain road from Medvedka to
Altaiskaya, over mighty open upland where the
great firs grasp the earth with talon-like roots. Here
and there along the road are Kirghiz tombs enclosed
by rude hurdles, reminding one of the palings of the
maral gardens. An occasional Russian hut, a mountain
stream pouring across a road, forests of stumps,
and again forests of those giant firs standing as against
the wind&mdash;storm trees, broad at base, needle-pointed
at the apex, every branch a strong son.</p>

<p>At Altaisky I proposed to stay a few weeks, and
then cross the mountains to the Kosh Agatch road,
northward toward Biisk; but the tidings of war came
across my plan here, and farther than the Altai I
did not go. But I had a quiet fortnight in a wonderful
spot&mdash;Altaiskaya, opposite Mount Belukha, one
of the great snow peaks that stand on sentry here
between China and Siberia, and I walked and
climbed. It would be a splendid place in which to
spend a whole summer. There are places that are so
placid and beautiful that you exclaim: &#8220;Good
heavens, this is a very paradise!&#8221; When you have
been there a day you want to stay there for ever, or
to go away and to return and return again. So it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
was at little Bobrovo on the Dwina, so again at
Altaisky. I thought to myself I shall come here
again and spend six months, and write a long and
interesting story. And I will ask &#8220;Pan&#8221; to come,
and he also will come and write a wonderful story.
&#8220;Pan&#8221; is an English friend, a great, tall, gentle,
quick-scented human, a dear mortal who snuffs the
air with his nose and can tell you thereby what has
happened in a place any time this three weeks past.</p>

<p>Altaiskaya was full of the freshness of youth, and
the air gave you wings and its valleys were full of
wonderful flowers. I have a long-acquired habit of
associating a certain phrase in the Lord&#8217;s Prayer
with the most beautiful thing I have seen during
the day, and if I have seen nothing beautiful, and
have been leading a dull life in a town, my mind
goes roving back to certain wondrous sights in the
past. Most frequently of all it goes to the wastes,
covered with crimson poppies, in Russian Central
Asia, and occasionally to the verdure and splendour
of the Altai and the delphiniums there, the blue,
purple and yellow monkshood, the China-blue larkspurs,
blue and purple larkspurs. A wonderful place
for flowers. Here are sweeps of blue sage, mauve
cranesbills poking everywhere, saffron poppies, grass
of Parnassus, campanula, pink moss flowers and giant
thistle-heads, gentian, Siberian iris.</p>

<p>Just outside the Cossack settlement it was late
summer, and the glossy peony fruits were turning
crimson from green, opening to show rows of black
teeth&mdash;seeds. But as you climbed upward toward the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
snow the season changed, and it was possible to
recover the lost spring.</p>

<p>The southern side of the mountains seemed to be
very bare, but our side, the northern one, was green.
It was comparatively easy to reach districts where
it might be thought no foot of man had ever trod&mdash;primeval
moss-grown forest, where were no tracks,
no flowers, nothing but firs and moss. Numberless
trees had fallen, and the moss had grown over them,
and, in climbing through, one helped oneself from
tree to tree, balancing and finding a footing. Above
this jungle was a stretch of steep mountain-side
sparsely grown with young firs, and then grey,
barren, slippery rock. Wonderful shelves and
chasms, fissures, precipices, and ways up without
ways down, boulder-strewn tracks and founts of
bubbling water, milk-white streams, crystal streams.</p>

<p>I was housed very well with a prosperous Cossack
family, and, except for the fact that there was a
terrible monotony in their dinners, had no reason
to complain. Every evening when I returned there
was beef &#8220;cutlets,&#8221; white scones and butter, a jug
of milk, and the samovar. The whole family was in
the fields hay-making all day, and were indisposed
to give time to cooking.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_230.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">ALTAISKA <i>STANITSA</i>: VIEW OF MOUNT BIELUKHA</p>

<p>Most days I spent by the side of a little mountain
river, where I built a sort of causeway out of rocks,
diverted the channel, made a deep bathing-pool&mdash;enthralling
occupations. Here also I had a bonfire,
made coffee, baked potatoes, cooked red currant jam.
Strips of red currants hung like bunting on some of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
the bushes, and were so thick that you could pick a
potful in a quarter of an hour. Here also I sorted
out and re-read thirty or forty copies of <i>The Times</i>,
saved up for me, with letters, at the post office of
Semipalatinsk&mdash;all the details of the political quarrel
over Ulster, the resignation of Sir John French (as
he was then called), of Colonel Seely, the vigorous
speeches of Mr. John Ward, the brilliant defences
of Mr. Asquith. We seemed to be running forward
silently and smoothly to an exciting rebellion or civil
war in Ireland, and nobody seemed to deplore the
prospect of strife. The Government, nominally in
favour of peace at all costs, were incapable of preventing
their opponents obtaining arms, and were,
therefore, allowing their friends to arm. On the
whole we seemed to be tired of the dull blessings of
peace, out of patience with peace. Yet we were not
ready for the strife that was coming, though certainly
in a mood to take arms. It is astonishing that with
our many international characters&mdash;those diplomatical
journalists of ours&mdash;we did not know what was
coming, or no one was at pains to undeceive us.
Journalists abroad, even if they are out of touch with
Courts and are uninfluential, have yet much greater
opportunities for understanding international situations
than Foreign Offices. Why is it that they
nearly always mislead? In our country a certain
glamour overspreads the personality of the polyglot
who writes of foreign Courts and foreign policies, but
as an observer of the Press for many years I can give
it as my opinion that, as a nation, we do not gain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
much from the pens of those journalists who run in
and out of chancelleries and are well known at
foreign Courts. In any case, as regards those who
dealt specially with Germany, Austria and the
Balkans at the time of the outbreak of war, they
were either blind or ignorant, which is unthinkable,
or mixed up somehow in the great German intrigue.</p>

<p>Silence reigned in Europe, and under cover of
that silence what tremendous preparations were being
made, what hurrying to and fro there was. It is
astonishing to look back now to those serene and
happy weeks in the Altai and to feel the contrast of
the innocence of Nature and the devilish conspiracy
in the minds of men. If there are devils in the
world, black spirits as opposed to white spirits, what
triumph was theirs, what hidden ecstasy as at the
coming triumph of negation. Behind the screen of
this silence horns were blowing announcing the great
feasts of death, the blasting of the temples wherein
the spirit of man dwells, the orgy of ugliness and
madness. But being, happily, untuned to this occult
world, we did not hear them.</p>

<p class="caption">MOBILISATION DAY ON THE ALTAI:<br /> THE VILLAGE EMPTIED OF ITS FOLK</p>

<p>It was holiday time, the end of July, the Englishman&#8217;s
great liberation moment when, even if he goes
on working in office or factory, he ceases to work
hard and lazes at his work. His wife and family have
gone to the seaside. He will join them in a week
or so. Meanwhile he is &#8220;camping out at home.&#8221;
The young man is buying stout boots and greasing
them for tramping, is scanning maps and guidebooks,
and making absurd tables of mileage, prospective<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
hotel bills and expenses. The teachers, with the
children, are liberated from the schools, and the
former are gone on Polytechnic tours and what not,
whilst the latter chalk mysterious diagrams on the
pavement and play hop-scotch, or play &#8220;Wallflowers,
wallflowers, growing up so high,&#8221; or &#8220;This
is the way she went.&#8221; The unfashionable but
numerous marriages take place of those who must
make the honeymoon coincide with annual leave, and
the happy couples take Cook&#8217;s tickets to Strasburg,
to the Tyrol, to Munich.</p>

<p>And those Russians who <i>must</i> escape their fellow-Russians,
and don&#8217;t like the bad drains of their own
watering-places, are off to German baths and
Bohemian and Austrian spas. Students are tripping
across to Switzerland. And on all in German territory
the guillotine of war is going to fall. At all
the money-changers&#8217; offices at Charing Cross and in
the City you can buy German marks, though there
is not much gold to be had. French gold, English,
Russian can be had in almost any quantities, and
Cook&#8217;s will sell you German hotel tickets for all
August.</p>

<p>One lazy July afternoon I sat on the wooden steps
leading up to my veranda and talked with a Cossack
on wars in general, what prospects of war there
actually were at that moment; and we concluded that
there might possibly be war with Austria. It was
the idlest talk, but the Cossack lives for a new war,
and I did not like to discourage him. He for his
part rather hoped for a nearer war; one with China<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
would suit him, but he&#8217;d thankfully consider a war
with Austria if nothing else were available.</p>

<p>I went along the exterior street of the village to
the little post office facing the wall of the White
Ones, as they call the Altai, and talked with the
postmaster about marals, and he closed the office to
go out and show me where his garden was. Here
also were several <i>maralniki</i>, and I found them when
clambering up the ridges, and the deer, seeing me,
would scamper away. The village had a butter
factory, and I used to go there and wait during the
last stages of production for a pound of butter, and,
sitting on a bucket upside down, chatted with other
villagers. Opposite the cottage where I stayed lived
the priest, and he often came across and talked.
The church was the next building after the priest&#8217;s
house, and was a beautiful little wooden temple built
by the peasants themselves. I was quickly in the
midst of the life of the settlement, and when the
news came I was at once thought to be the obvious
person to apply to for information. On the 30th of
July, after a long day on the mountains, I slept
serenely on the overcoats on the floor of my Cossack
habitation. Next morning came the young horseman
with the red flag flying from his shoulder, and the
tremendous excitement and clamour of the reception
of the <i>ukase</i> to mobilise for war. As I wrote when
I described this in &#8220;Russia and the World,&#8221; the
Cossacks were not told with whom the war was or
would be, and one of the first surmises that they
made was that the war must be with England&mdash;crafty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
old England, who always stood in Russia&#8217;s way and
was siding with the Turks again. Or she was afraid
Russia was going to attack India.</p>

<p>The real news came at last, and with it the
necessity to return to Europe as soon as possible.
The war came across my summer as it came across
the summer of thousands of others, cutting life into
two very distinct parts. At the village of Altaisky I
must draw my war line dividing past and present,
one part of life from this other new astonishing part.
The story of my journey has drawn to its close.
Before, however, leaving the subject of Russian
Central Asia I would give the thoughts and reflections
that the journey has suggested, and especially
those referring to Anglo-Russian rivalry in empire,
the questions of India and Constantinople, the future
of our friendship and of the two empires.</p>

<small>RUSSIA AND INDIA AND THE PROSPECTS OF
ANGLO-RUSSIAN FRIENDSHIP</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE prospects of Anglo-Russian friendship are
very fair at the moment of writing, the after-the-war
prospects. Generally speaking, international
amity or hostility has heretofore depended on the
absence or presence of clashing interests. Russia does
not stand on our road of Empire, and has never
fought us and could never fight us commercially as
Germany has done. Our only doubt about Russia
has been as to her possible designs on India. Fifty
years ago there were few Englishmen who did not
entertain expectations of eventual war with Russia,
and after the annexation of Merv, and the running
of the Central Asian Railway thither, Beaconsfield
was obliged to assure us that the keys of India were
to be found in London, and consisted in the spirit
and determination of the British people. We felt we
were secure because we could fight Russia and did
not fear her. As Lord Curzon wrote in his book on
Russian Central Asia:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The day that a Russian army starts forth from
Balkh for the passes of the Hindu Kush, or marches
out of the southern gate of Herat <i>en route</i> for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
Kandahar, we may say, as Cromwell did at Dunbar:
&#8216;Now hath the Lord delivered them into my
hand.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Our other bond of security lay in the fact that
the Russians knew they could not successfully attack
us. Though it must be said now, after our thwarted
efforts against the Turks on Gallipoli and our experience
in Mesopotamia, that it is not clear that we could
count on winning a distant war of invasion. Though we
are increasing daily in military power and sagacity, as a
result of fighting the Germans, we are not so military
a nation as we were in the days of the Crimean War.
But the invasion of India by Russia may well be put
out of the head once and for all. No statesman in
Russia ever seriously contemplated it, and in this
country those statesmen who thought of it either
decried the idea or used it as a political bogey. As
Namirovitch Danchenko said recently: &#8220;From my
seventy years&#8217; knowledge of Russian life, I should
say that the people who dreamt about the conquest
of India could be found in Russia only in a mad-house.&#8221;
No serious steps were ever taken to thwart
Russian imperial policy in Central Asia, and all that
fear has brought about was mistrust and a refusal to
enter into partnership with Russia in certain schemes
in Asia.</p>

<p>The Russians have been ready to trust us for a
long time, and they were anxious for an Anglo-Russian
agreement even at the time when the invasion
of India bogey was most in the air here.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
Probably the Germans, those persistent enemies of
Anglo-Russian friendship, were responsible for a great
deal of subterranean propaganda in England. Many
in England were pro-Russian&mdash;Gladstone (though, of
course, even Gladstone asked for a war credit on
one occasion of fear of Russia), Carlyle, Froude,
Kinglake&mdash;there was a real basis of sympathy. But
the poisoners of the mind of the British people
succeeded. What an interesting glimpse of popular
feeling is found in Burnaby&#8217;s &#8220;Ride to Khiva&#8221; if
we read it now. There is a certain poignancy in his
remarks. Consider this passage to-day:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Another peculiarity in several Russians which I
remarked ... was their desire to impress upon my
mind the great advantage it would be for England
to have a civilised neighbour like Russia on her
Indian frontier; and when I did not take the trouble
to dissent from their views&mdash;for it is a waste of
breath to argue with Russians about this question&mdash;how
eager they were for me to impress their line of
thought upon the circle of people with whom I was
most immediately connected. Of course, the arguments
brought forward were based upon purely
philanthropic motives, upon Christianity and civilisation.
They said that the two great Powers ought to
go together hand in glove; that there ought to be
railways all through Asia, formed by Anglo-Russian
companies; that Russia and England had every
sympathy in common which should unite them; that
they both hated Germany and loved France; that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
England and Russia could conquer the world, and
so on.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a line of reasoning delightfully Russian,
and though I was not so rude as to differ from my
would-be persuaders, and lent an attentive ear to all
their eloquence, I could not help thinking that the
mutual sympathy between England and Germany is
much greater than that between England and Russia;
that the Christian faith as practised by the lower
orders in Russia is pure paganism in comparison with
the Protestant religion which exists in Prussia and
Great Britain; that Germany and Great Britain are
natural allies against Russia ... that Germans and
Englishmen understand by the term &#8216;Russian civilisation&#8217;
something diametrically opposite to what is
attributed to it by those people who form their ideas
of Muscovite progress from the few Russians they
meet abroad.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Burnaby&#8217;s remarks seem pretty foolish in 1916.
And his views are representative of the views of
many English in 1875. Prussia, whom he admires
so, had just crushed the French whilst we stood by.
The Boer War had not come. The Kaiser had not
sent his telegram to Kruger. Our military conceit
had not been taken out of us; and so, when
Russia offers Britannia the hand of friendship,
Britannia round her draws her cloak and folds her
arms.</p>

<p>But Russia was sincere. She admired the
English. She alone of Continental nations appreciated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
the spirit of Dickens and our Victorian
novelists. England was still the foolish friend of
Turkey, it is true, but she was not <i>perfide Albion</i>.
Nor was she simply &#8220;Mr. Cotton,&#8221; as Ibsen dismissed
us, or &#8220;a nation of shopkeepers.&#8221; From the
first Russia has had some sort of <i>flair</i> for the English
gentleman, has seen the best thing in our race; and
their wish for friendship with us has been a sentimental
matter, not a desire for commercial partnership,
not a bond of sympathy between revolutionary
Russia and our Socialists. The desire for friendship
with England dates to before the emergence of our
Socialists as a party in England. It is a genuine
craving for mutual understanding between the real
Russia and the real England.</p>

<p>Fortunately, that desire on Russia&#8217;s part found
an answer on this side. We became friends&mdash;we are
now brothers-in-arms against a common foe. If the
shedding of blood for a common ideal strengthens
friendship, we should be good friends for this generation
at least. Those who are young now will keep
in remembrance the stress of these days, the sacrifice,
the common sadness, the shared triumph. Holy
Russia has become near to us, and, despite all
machinations and insinuations, will remain near.
And, with the hope of making things more easy,
let me indicate the points of resistance to Russian
friendship still remaining in our national life.</p>

<p>I. <i>India.</i>&mdash;A number of our people, chiefly on
the Unionist side in politics, still fear Russian designs
on India, and for that reason deny Russia the right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
to Constantinople and the Straits, should she take
them. In doing this they unwittingly play the
German game, which is to reserve Constantinople for
Germany. There are several European journalists in
the pay of Germany, and among other things they
do for their money is the stirring up of British
suspicion about Constantinople and Russia. The fact
is that this is Russia&#8217;s legitimate outlet, her front
door, and there can be no settled peace in Europe
as long as it is barred up or liable to be barred. It
is also the seat and capital of the Russian faith, and
what in 1876 Dostoieffsky answered to the question
on what high ground Russia demanded Constantinople
from Europe is still true:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;As the leader of Orthodoxy, as protectress and
preserver of Orthodoxy, the r&ocirc;le predestined for
Russia since the days of Ivan III. ... that the
nations professing Orthodoxy may be unified under
her, that the Slav nations may know that her protection
is the guarantee of their individual personality
and the safeguard against mutual hostility. Such a
union would not be for the purpose of political
aggression and tyranny, not a matter of commercial
gain. No, it will be a raising of Christ&#8217;s truth, preserved
in the East, a real new raising of Christ&#8217;s
Cross, and the conclusive word of Orthodoxy at the
head of which will be Russia.... And if anyone
holds that the &#8216;new word&#8217; which Russia will speak
is &#8216;utopia,&#8217; worthy only of mockery, then I must be
numbered among the Utopians&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
</div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>Still, it must be said that at the present moment
Constantinople does not seem likely to fall as a fruit
to the Allies or to Russia, and unless Bulgaria should
turn upon her unnatural allies there is not much
question of St. Sophia becoming Christian again.
We ought only to keep in mind that Russia has
striven for Constantinople not to have a base from
which to oppose us, but in order to keep the door of
her own house and to be Queen of the Eastern
Church.</p>

<p>The next point, and where the question of India
causes us to be suspicious, is that of Persia. Here,
happily, some understanding has been obtained and
spheres of influence allotted; but our distrust has
stood in the way of the consummation of one of the
most interesting schemes of the century: the trans-Persian
railway. If this railway had been built
before the outbreak of this world-war, it would have
been of extraordinary value to the Allies, an effectual
means of checking the inflammation of Islam. There
will be little money left when the war is over, but
certainly the overland route to India should be one
of the first big civilising schemes to receive attention.
World railways, instead of little bits of lines, belong
to the future of the Old World, and we can have
them now or put it off for another era. It depends
on the faith and imagination of our generation.
Then Persia falls inevitably under European surveillance,
and there is no reason for English and
Russians at the outposts of Empire to compete and
be jealous and suspicious and to squabble.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>For the rest, Russian Central Asia raises no
further problems. It is a peaceful, growing Russian
colony, shut away from the chances of attack by
foreign Powers&mdash;likely to remain for a thousand years
one of the most peaceful places upon earth. Unlike
India, it is comparatively empty and its peoples are
decaying. The railways which Russia has built were
built in order to subdue the Tekintsi and the
Afghans. The railways which she is building have
in view only the convenience of the colonists, the
development of the colony, and trade with China.
Russia is slow out there, and she is laying the sound
foundations of a healthy and happy colonial country.</p>

<p>II. <i>Rivalry of Empire.</i>&mdash;Whatever be the direct
issue of the war with Germany, one indirect result
seems certain: England will have more empire,
whilst Germany will have less, and Russia will not
lose anything. Two great empires will emerge more
clearly, facing one another because of the dispersal
of the German ambition. There seems to be only
one possibility of German extension, and that lies in
the chance of Germans and Austrians turning on
their own allies and absorbing Bulgaria and Turkey.
But that chance must be considered remote to-day.
The Russian and the British Empires will stand facing
one another in friendly comparison. The Russian
Empire is self-supporting, it has no need to import
the necessities of life&mdash;food, fuel, raiment; whereas
we could support ourselves, but do not, not having
reconciled our self-hostile commercial interests. For
many a long day Russia will export for British consumption<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
corn, butter, eggs, sugar, wool, and wood,
to say nothing of other things. And when at last
we succeed in making our own Empire independent,
the Russians will eat their butter themselves and
there will be more white bread on the peasant&#8217;s
table. It will be no calamity for Russia.</p>

<p>I was speaking on the future of the Russian
Empire at one of our leading Conservative clubs in
London last winter, and I was surprised to note a
very important feeling of opposition toward Russia.
Those who were interested in manufactures wanted
the tariff against British goods reduced, and those
who were Imperialist in spirit felt a certain jealousy
and suspicion of the Russian Empire. Several
speakers warned Russia that she had better give up
the dream of having Constantinople&mdash;it would be bad
for her health if she were to have it. But the most significant
utterance came from an ardent tariff reformer,
who did not know how far love of Russia was compatible
with love of the British Empire, for more
Russian grain coming to us meant less Canadian grain,
and so on. If we gave Russia any preferential treatment
as regards her exports to us, we handicapped
our own colonies. We ought to give our colonies preferential
terms, but how would the Russians feel if
we asked for reduced tariffs for the import of our
manufactured goods into Russia while at the same
time we put a tax on the produce they sent to us.
That problem is a serious one, and it cannot be
doubted that the best policy for us is to make ourselves
self-dependent as an Empire whatever it may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
cost us in foreign favour. Russia must not misunderstand
our efforts to consolidate the Empire, and I do
not think she will. The diminution in our import
of food-stuffs from Russia will be gradual, and will be
made up partially by the increased import of other
things which Russia has in superabundance. Yet
even as regards ores and mineral products we have to
learn to be self-supporting. The war itself, which
shuts us off from Russia and throws us upon our own
resources, has sent us to our own colonies. We are
beginning to find in the Empire not only our food,
but also the raw materials required for our products.
Take, for instance, the case of asbestos. The only
first-class quality of asbestos in the world comes from
the Urals, and it is a product of great value industrially.
During the war it has been very difficult to
get it from Russia. The result has been that we
have found a very good though still inferior quality
in Rhodesia, and may quite conceivably obtain all our
best supplies from that colony in time, the lower
grades coming from Canada, which begins to have a
great output. But our tendency to be self-dependent
will tend to rid Russia of many exploiting foreign
companies, and for that the Russian people will be
thankful. They want to experience what gifts they
have for doing things for themselves.</p>

<p>III. <i>The Trade Treaty.</i>&mdash;Russia will be so much
in debt to us financially at the end of the war that
there will be a tendency to regard her as an insolvent
liability company possessing valuable assets. Some of
our business men may want to treat her as such and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
appoint a trustee, so to say. There is a movement
to inflict upon Russia a trade treaty similar to that,
or even more humiliating than that which Germany
called upon her to sign. The bond of friendship with
Russia cannot be a commercial halter round her
neck. She would quickly resent foreign financial
control, no matter from what quarter it might be
exercised. Russia will be all but bankrupt after the
war, and all that she will have lost will have been lost
for the common cause. We should be generous to
her and see what can be done, not to tie her and
bind her industrially and financially, but for us all.
Russia herself is ready to make a kindly treaty providing
us with real advantages over Germany, but
she could not make a treaty whereby arrangements
would be made for the paying off of her financial
war debts to her allies.</p>

<p>IV. <i>The Basis of Friendship.</i>&mdash;The basis of
friendship with Russia is not really trade, and no
provision needs to be made to make a trade basis.
We had plenty of trade with Germany or Germany
with us, and that did not make for friendship. On
the contrary, the question of trade and of haggling
over money is almost certain in the long run to lead
to estrangement, or, at least, mutual dis-esteem.
There has been a growing trade, but that has not
led to the growing friendship. Friendship has been
founded on real mutual admiration. We like the
Russians, and they like us. The positive side of
Russia profoundly interests us. Of course, we are
not vitally interested in the negative side, the rotten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
conditions of life in certain classes, the faults of
Russia, the seamy side of the picture. We are
thoroughly aware of the ugliness of the negative side
of our own life, and we would ask&mdash;do not judge us
by that, that is not England. Similarly, in Russia
we are interested in beautiful and wonderful Russia,
in Holy Russia, not in unholy Russia. This positive
side is comparatively unrealised here, for gossip and
slander make more noise than truth, but in it is a
great treasure both for Russia and for ourselves in
friendship. On the whole the prospects are good.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">APPENDIX II<br />


<small>THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE AND THE BRITISH EMPIRE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE moment of peace will be the moment of
reconsideration. We shall want to know where
we all stand, and we shall want to face the facts&mdash;financially,
individually, imperially. We shall want
to know what we have got, what we owe, what sort
of empire we have to make or mar in the succeeding
years, what are its resources, what its possibilities,
and ours. One may remark, in passing, what very
good work is being done by the Confederation of the
Round Table.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> The calculation is exercising many
patriotic British minds. First of all be it remarked,
in order to remove misconceptions, we British people
are not by any means the most numerous white
people. We have in our Empire something like
63 million whites, whereas Russia has at least 140
million, Germany has 65 million, and the United
States have 82 million of mixed race. We compare
favourably with the United States because we are
homogeneous and much more calm in soul, and
favourably with Germany because she has no land
for expansion, though it must be remembered that if
Austria and Germany should unite, the Germans
would have almost as large a white population as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
Russia, and certainly a very much more active one.
There remains Russia, with its enormous population
and its astonishingly extensive territory. Russia has
ample room for ten times her present population,
and she has it at her back door, as it were. She
has no oceans to cross. The railway goes all the way
or can go all the way from Petrograd to the uttermost
ends of her earth. She has also calm, and can
develop without worry. As an empire, compared
with ours, she has tremendous advantages. Her
people are not impatient to be rich, the strain of
her race is not confused through foreign immigration,
she is shut off from mongrelising influences,
and tends to grow with pure blood and a clear understanding
of her own past and her own destiny. She
has less chance of making mistakes. And, as I have
said, her problems are much simpler. It is not
difficult to keep the stream of colonisation moving
into the emptiness of Asia when the railways are so
good as to carry one six thousand miles for thirteen
roubles, a little over a sovereign.</p>

<p>Our younger politicians have got to decide what
they are working for&mdash;trade, or the Empire, or the
people, or the individual. They must affirm a larger
policy than has been affirmed heretofore, a world
policy, and they must not scorn the lessons which
Germany has taught them: the necessity to be
thorough, to have large conceptions, and to work for
the realisation of these large conceptions rather than
potter about doctoring the little-English constitution
here and giving a little funeral there. We teach our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
children a very foolish little proverb: that if we
look after the pence the pounds will look after themselves.
That is the opposite of the truth, which is,
that if we look after the pounds we need never worry
our heads about the pennies. If we nationalised our
ocean-transit, we should not need to insure our working
men against unemployment. If we scheduled the
enormous tracts of land available for culture in the
Empire, we should not need to wage war with the
landowners in Great Britain.</p>

<p>Our present Colonial Minister, Mr. Bonar Law,
has risen to the front as the political leader of our
Conservative and Imperialist party. He does not
seem to love party strife, and he has, perhaps, found
a permanent post at the Colonial Office. He is the
next man of importance after Mr. Joseph Chamberlain,
and though by no means so great a man, he is
an admiring follower of the great Imperialist. Whatever
we may think of the merits of Free Trade and
Protection, Chamberlain was undoubtedly right in
his larger conception of a unified British Empire, a
<i>Zollverein</i>. And the Liberals who opposed him and
confused the issue were merely opportunists. They
were not concerned to find what they could agree
with in his proposals. They merely fought him to
beat him and step into his shoes politically. The
riff-raff of political opportunists set on him, and he
was forced to shed one of his great illusions, a trust
in the common sense of the people. Mr. Bonar Law
is his successor, and we wish him well. He might
well carry his office out of the arena of party politics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
and sit at the Colonial Office whatever wind were
blowing. For Imperial Policy must have continuity
if it is to be successful.</p>

<p>England must hope and pray that Mr. Law has
given up mere politics. We are thoroughly sick of
the bad-tempered quarrelling and malicious fighting
of the heads of the parties. Even a first-rate man
is ninth-rate when he is quarrelling, and a quarrel
among politicians is always a quarrel among ninth-rate
politicians. Political genius likes affirmation
and agreement. The task of Mr. Bonar Law is
to think about the Empire and gain consciousness
of its true destiny; it is not to think out
devices in political antagonism. As a nation we
demand he give his whole time and the cream of his
intellect to the positive task of giving to every citizen
of the Empire the consciousness of the large thing.
He will be attacked; curs will bark at him; the
Germans and German Jews will try and stir up the
uneducated against him; there will be all manner of
insinuations. But he need never reply or attempt to
defend himself. The nation and the Empire will
back him calmly. There is a splendid Russian tale
of a prince climbing a mountain to obtain a bird, and
all the stones behind him shout abuse after him.
He is safe on his quest on this condition only, that
he does not turn round and listen, or draw his sword
to attack. If he turn he will change to a stone himself.
The point is, we are going to be more in need
of great men once this war is over than we ever were
before&mdash;of great men with big ideas, faith that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
can be realised, and that calm of spirit which is the
greatest strength.</p>

<p>If Mr. Bonar Law is not great enough, or if he&#8217;d
rather continue in the political arena, there is another
man for the post, and that is Lord Milner. Lord
Milner strikes one as the greater man. The Empire
is his one idea. He thinks largely&mdash;his imagination
takes him in vast sweeps over the surface of the
Empire. He has dignity, is a powerful speaker, and
a clear thinker on Imperial matters. His weakness
is a certain aloofness or reserve, an ambassadorial
manner, and one is not quite sure what is behind it.
Mr. Bonar Law, on the other hand, is unscreened;
he is familiar, even domestic in his manner. Probably
what Mr. Law has to guard against is doing
things in small parcels, doing branch things rather
than root things, whereas Lord Milner may give
offence occasionally by a lack of consideration for
other people&#8217;s feelings&mdash;want of tact, in fact. In any
case they are both men on whom the eyes of the
nation rest. Lord Milner has sent me an extremely
interesting letter which had been addressed to him
by a number of British citizens who have become lost
to the British Empire. By his kind permission I
reproduce it:</p>

the report of your speech appearing in <i>The Times</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
Weekly Edition of Nov. 19th. You mentioned the
indifference of the working man to Imperial affairs.
I am a working man, and possibly my views on these
questions may be of some small interest to you.
When I speak of my views I mean that they also are
the views of other workers with whom I come in
contact. I mix daily with several dozen workers,
British born, and I assure you that the opinions here
expressed are the opinions of practically all.</p>

<p>&#8220;We believe that right now a strong committee
should be formed to deal with Imperial reconstruction
after the war. This committee should have a well
thought out, clearly defined, and decisive policy to
put in operation the moment the war ends. We
believe that not less than half a million soldiers who
have fought in the war should be settled in Canada,
Australasia and U.S. Africa, and that an appropriation
of not less than one billion<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> pounds sterling
should be voted for the purpose. Canada is a land
of vast agricultural possibilities and great mineral
wealth. A small group of the best agricultural and
engineering experts in the Empire should be sent
over to make all necessary preparations for the coming
of the men. The exact location or locations where
they are to settle should be defined, lines of branch
railways should be surveyed, sites of model garden
cities, cement built, should be located, mining properties
surveyed, and the location of factories and
workshops should be decided upon. Nothing should
be left to chance. The gang ploughs, threshing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
machines, motor tractors, grain elevators, etc., should
be provided and run on the co-operative principle, and
the entire properties should belong to the nation. If
one-half the energy, foresight, and preparation used
in the war were used for the reconstruction, the scheme
is an assured success.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are great irrigation and artesian possibilities
in S. Africa. Preparations should be made <i>now</i>.
Incidentally the intensely loyalist stock thus settled
would swamp the Hertzog party with their disruptive
ideals. In Australia very great possibilities await
irrigation. I have only to point out what has been
done in arid S. California and Arizona to prove this.</p>

<p>&#8220;The British Empire heretofore has been more or
less imaginary; there has been nothing tangible about
it. Take my own case, for instance. I cite it merely
because it illustrates a principle. Seven years ago I
was in Scotland and unemployed. There were a
great many unemployed at the time. Those who had
no means were left to starve. Was anything done
for them? Absolutely nothing! All were British,
loved Britain, were able and willing to work, yet no
organisation was created to utilise their services.
Personally I came to the United States. I have done
better here than at home; had better pay, shorter
hours, better conditions. What is the British Empire
to us? Absolutely nothing; a mere sentiment. Yet
our feelings are British still, our sympathies are
British; but that is not enough. There must be
something tangible to go on, something <i>real</i>; sentiment
alone is no use. An Englishman here whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
I meet daily is a veteran of the S. African war.
When that war finished he was not allowed to settle
in S. Africa. At home he could not get work.
He was driven to want. He had to pawn his medal
to live, and finally was assisted to America. He has
done well here and has been steadily employed. But
he has been embittered, and his sentiment in his own
words is: &#8216;To hell with the British Empire.&#8217; It is
an empty phrase to him, without meaning; and I tell
you, with all the earnestness of which I am capable,
that these things will mean the decline and fall of
the Empire if they do not stop. In the United
States there are several million British-born who are
lost to the Empire for ever. Their sentiments are
British, their sympathies are British, but their interests
are here, and interest becomes sentiment.
And observe that their children born here have <i>sentiment</i>
as well as interest for the land of their birth.</p>

<p>&#8220;The British Empire is the largest in the world.
In natural resources it is the wealthiest. It could
support a population of hundreds of millions in a
high degree of prosperity. The British are an able
and intelligent people. The nation is rich. The
problem is to settle the people throughout the
Empire and develop its resources under the guidance
of experts, according to a well thought out and
definite plan. This plan wants to take shape now.
If the war were to suddenly end one year hence, and
an army of three million men disbanded, we would
(and will) be faced by industrial chaos. The problem
must be placed in the hands of experts, and be so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
clearly worked out that when peace is declared the
soldiers will be drafted without fuss to the various
parts of the Empire, and immediately tackle the
problems of city and railway building, agriculture
and irrigation, mining and manufacturing. And
these properties must be owned by the nation.
These measures will create a <i>real</i> Empire in which
every citizen will have a tangible interest. Each part
will legislate on its own domestic affairs, and the
Imperial Parliament, dealing with Imperial affairs
and representative of all the Dominions, will be held
in London. With such conditions you will find a
strong sentiment for Free Trade within the Empire
and Protection without, and also a strong desire for
that universal military training which will defend what
in very truth is one&#8217;s own. Start this programme at
once, and do it thoroughly, and you can be absolutely
certain of a solid and enthusiastic backing.&mdash;Believe
me, yours sincerely,</p>

<p>I will add a letter sent to me from Tasmania,
for it will help to give the atmosphere of the

<span class="indentright2">&#8220;<i>Oct. 3rd, 1915.</i></span></p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am just being interested in your
book, &#8216;Russia and the World.&#8217; I read it because I
was delighted with your vagabond trip along the
Euxine shores. You deal with the problems of the
British Empire. Perhaps you might like to get a
view from &#8216;down under&#8217;? Well, I do not consider
in the matter of defence that a huge land empire has
advantages over a sea empire. Russia is to-day more
vulnerable than the British Empire. Let us suppose
the British Isles with a navy such as it possesses
to-day, with a million men ready for home defence,
and with an expeditionary force of 250,000 men&mdash;&#8216;ready&#8217;
at an hour&#8217;s notice to step into transports
also ready. Let us assume that two-years&#8217; provision
of corn is stored, and a tunnel with France. Let us
also assume that every available rood of British
ground is cultivated. What country could invade and
conquer the British Isles? What country could keep
up a two-years&#8217; naval war? Let us come to
Australia&mdash;grand in her isolation. We shall soon
have a quarter of a million of trained soldiers. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
launched a new cruiser last week, and we are going
to build submarines. We can not only defend ourselves,
but we could supply garrisons for India. So
far as external aggression is concerned, South Africa
is safe. Canada is liable to attack from the
Americans, and in the course of time will be
attacked. If the British expeditionary army were
landed promptly, and Canada had our plan of compulsory
service, the Empire would be right there.
India is safe except from Russia.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have we a weak spot as an Empire? Certainly
we have. England for three parts of a century has
allowed herself to be bled to death by the emigration
of her best youth to foreign countries. That ought
to be stopped. There should be an export tax of
&pound;20 upon every emigrant to the United States or
other alien country. (Plain talk about U.S.A.) As
to the present &#8216;colonies&#8217;&mdash;hateful title&mdash;there are
but two British ones within the Empire&mdash;Australia
and New Zealand. The others have an undesirable
mixture of races. It should be a portion of the
Imperial policy to fill up Canada and South Africa
with British-born people. But such emigration must
be upon a system. Under a proper system we could
do with two millions of immigrants in Australia.
Suddenly dumped upon our wharves, 1,000 would be
an inconvenience. Your scheme of cheap ships is
admirable. When we build railways in Australia,
and provide water schemes, we do not consider
whether they will &#8216;pay,&#8217; but whether they will
develop the country and add to the happiness of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
people. The best method of emigration is to dispatch
from the United Kingdom every year, say,
500,000 youths and girls from 15 years of age and
upwards. These would find homes <i>at low wages</i> in
settlers&#8217; families in Canada, South Africa and Australia,
and would become acclimatised and absorbed
into the population. This emigration should be a
State scheme and <span class="allsmcap">COMPULSORY</span>. But the emigrants
should not be made slaves of. When their indentures
ended they should be allowed, if they wished, to
return to England in one of your ships free of charge.
I do not wish to enlarge upon the subject, but the
failures of adult English immigrants who come here
are pathetic. They cannot get along, neither would
we get along in England. The immigrant should be
captured young. This is the greatest problem of the
Empire:</p>

<p>&#8220;(1) To fill up the Empire with loyal citizens of
pure British birth.</p>

<p>&#8220;(2) In the cases of Canada and South Africa,
to send large numbers in order to neutralise the alien
elements now existing there. To stop foreign immigration
into British territories, especially German
immigration.</p>

<p>&#8220;Upon the question of naturalisation we have
been too easy and indifferent. A man wishing to be
naturalised should make a solemn application in
<i>propria persona</i> before a court. He should be under
the obligation to abjure his foreign nationality and
to take a British name. We have now our directories
crowded with foreign names, which through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
generations of intermarriages have lost their original
national significance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I note that you compare our culture with that
of America. Thanks! No two countries could be
more dissimilar&mdash;there is not amongst us the greed,
the wild rush, or the boastfulness of the Americans.
We do not like them. While we are on comparisons,
let me remind you that while you have failed to
adjust your Irish question, we have federated Australia,
a task of no small difficulty. While you have
been talking and spilling ink about conscription, we
have a system of compulsory training, both for the
army and the navy, in full operation. While you
allow strikes in the midst of war, our difficulties are
being settled by wages boards and arbitration courts.
We are not perfect, but our Press is much superior
in tone and culture to yours. It is painful to read
some of your Yankeeised London papers. In literature
we have given you Mrs. Humphry Ward,
though to learn new sins we read the indecent novels
which appear to be the chief product of British fiction.
And we have given the world&mdash;Melba!</p>

<p>&#8220;As to our share of the war. I walked down-street
in Hobart yesterday to take a &#8216;billy&#8217;&mdash;pity
your simplicity if you do not know what that is&mdash;to
the City Hall. It was filled with all sorts of good
things for our boys at Gallipoli for Christmas. Outside
the newspaper office I read the cable, another
ghastly list of Australian casualties. Were they
necessary? Could not the Turks have been outflanked
and their communications cut? When I reached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
home my wife and her friend were knitting socks for
the soldiers. The lady friend mentioned, be it correct
or not, that a ship that declined to carry troops&mdash;the
<i>Wimmera</i>, New Zealand to Melbourne&mdash;was
taken possession of and forced to take the men. The
streets are full of soldiers ready to sail, and, alas,
with many returned from the war crippled for life.
And such splendid young men. What an improved
edition of the British race the Australians are!</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough from stranger to stranger, but as your
book seems to indicate gleams of intelligence on your
part, and as it interested me, I am humbly&mdash;as a
native-born Australian now close approaching the
Psalmist&#8217;s limit&mdash;endeavouring to repay the compliment.&mdash;Yours
truly,</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>The letters indicate something of the spirit of our
people, and they more than touch on the &#8220;after-the-war&#8221;
problems of the Empire. Both indicate the
way we lose our citizens to the United States of
America. And it is, of course, loss to the Empire
whenever an Englishman settles in the U.S.A. Our
social interchange with the United States is a snare
for us. The gleam of their dollars is the Star-spangled
Banner, and not the Union Jack. We do not see
that, although the Americans speak a recognisable
dialect of our language, they are a foreign people,
with their own national interests. When a man or
woman goes there to settle he is lost to us, and if in
the great unrest after the war a great number of our
young people set sail for &#8220;God&#8217;s own country,&#8221; it
will mean that we can add the numbers of those
young people to the total of our casualties. That
is clear.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>Then we cannot afford to imitate the ways of the
U.S.A. The U.S.A. receive the discontented and
rebellious of all nations in Europe&mdash;it is Europe&#8217;s
safety-valve. Our Irish go there, German anti-militarists,
Russian Jews and Finns, Austrian Slavs and
what not. The nature of the United States is composite
and its task is synthesis. The nature of our Empire
is elementary and its task is to keep pure. Canada
has made a mistake in opening its doors to aliens,
and especially to those aliens who would stand a poor
chance of passing the tests at Ellis Island. Canada
behaves as if it were left behind in the struggle by
America, as if she had been asleep in the past and
was now making up for lost ground by any and every
means. She is virtually accepting those aliens whom
the U.S.A. consider not good enough to take.
Through the help of Tolstoy and the Quakers the
Dukhobors were dumped down on Canadian soil.
They have refused to become naturalised British subjects,
and have sacrificed estates to the value of over
three million dollars&mdash;&#8220;in the name of the equality of
all people upon earth we would not be naturalised,
and we sacrificed this material fortune.&#8221; They
learn no English, conform to no English rules,
nourish no English sentiments, are lost to Russia,
and are no use to us. The same may be said of the
hundreds of thousands of other aliens we are letting
in. It should be obvious that to lose British-born
citizens, our own spirit, flesh and blood, in the United
States, and at the same time to take those aliens
who cannot pass the doctor and the immigration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
examination at New York, is a woeful and even
ridiculous circumstance.</p>

<p>After the war America will be extremely rich and
we extremely poor. She will be in a position to buy
everything that is offered for sale. We must take
care not to offer birthrights in any shape or form.
That which we can legitimately sell let us sell, but
that which is in the nature of an heirloom of the
British people let us not be tempted to sell, no matter
how high the mountain of dollars be piled on the
American shore or how dazzlingly it may shine in
the sunshine. I say this with no malice against the
American people. They are a splendid people, and
they are working out their own ideals. They are
carrying out their ideals of town-planning, marriage-planning,
slum-raising, park-planting, wages-raising
beyond anything we dream of here. When I wrote
in my book on America that we British were the
dying West whereas America was the truly living
West, I was taken up by British critics as if I had
said something very disparaging about my own
people. That was a mistake. I do not desire to see
my own people a Western people, such as the
Americans are, but rather a nation seated between
the East and the West. Some of us fondly think
ourselves Western in our ideals, but the fact is the
Americans have left us far behind, and we can never
catch up because we do not really believe in these
ideals. But we can gain immensely by seeing America
<i>go ahead</i>. Let us shake hands with America; she is
splendid. God speed! Go on, work out your ideals,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
let us see you as you wish to be. Meanwhile we will
go on with our own problems and the realisation of
our own ideals.</p>

<p>With America on the West then also with Russia
on the East&mdash;shake hands! Thanks to Russia, and
God be with her also. Let her realise her ideals
and discover what she is; we shall learn from the
spectacle of her self-realisation. And meanwhile we
will go on with our own problems and the realisation
of our own ideals.</p>

<p>We who write about foreign countries are the
torch-bearers to foreign progress and the means of
foreign friendship. We render good service, and if
our light shine well and show clear pictures it is
unfair to reproach us with a wish to Russianise or
Americanise or whatever it is. Our function is a
legitimate one, and, far from confusing or alienating
our readers, our hearts are actually with our own
nation and we help our fellow-countrymen to see
themselves as quite distinctive. Our minds certainly
are confused by the writings and sayings of those
stay-at-home folk who imagine that difference of
nationality is only difference of speech and customs,
and perhaps of dress, not understanding that first of
all it is difference of soul and difference in destiny.</p>

<p>To return to the comparison of the two Empires
and the consideration of the colonial letters, Mr.
Anderson asks for an Imperial Commission to consider
the &#8220;after-the-war&#8221; problems, and in conversation
with Mr. Bonar Law I learn that such a
Commission is to sit, and there is the possibility of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
Imperial Parliament being formed. This ought to be
taken up warmly by our people at home. I also
discussed with Mr. Law the prospects of emigration
after the war. There is a great unrest in the Army.
Great numbers of men have one common opinion
that they are not going to return to the old dull grind
in factory and office after the war is over. They are
going in for an open-air life, going to Canada, going
to Australia, or going to take up land at home in
Great Britain. The Canadians and Australians have
served their home lands well by telling the men at
home what it is like in the far parts of the Empire.
Our men have a genuine admiration for the physique
of our Colonials. The fine bodies and good spirits of
these men speak for themselves, and then they are
full of talk of a rich country, beautiful Nature, wildness,
big chances, prosperity. It is no wonder that
the Englishman wants to go there also when the war
is over. There will be a great readiness to go. The
question is what facilities will be given them to go?
How much will it cost and how much land will they
be given, and what status will they have within the
Empire? Mr. Law was not inclined to give much
answer to that, and he reminded me that we wanted
to get some more men back to the land in our own
country. The back-to-the-land movement here is,
however, of little importance if we are going to look
upon the whole Empire as a British unity and feel
that a man on the land in Australia can be of more
significance than a man on the land in Essex.</p>

<p>I asked Mr. Bonar Law whether he thought that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
our manufacturers here would be dismayed at the
prospect of so many young men going to the
Colonies, would they not oppose facilities being
given? Would they not feel that it was necessary to
keep the labour market overflowing with labour in
order to keep labour cheap? In any case, would they
not feel they needed to keep the men in England?
The foundation of personal wealth is a plenitude of
labour. The more hands employed, the richer the
man at the top. Mr. Law did not think they were
likely to raise objections.</p>

<p>The overcrowding in the United Kingdom is
much greater than in France or Germany or Italy.
India is also terribly over-crowded, but Canada and
Australia and South Africa are practically empty.
The only nation that occupies the correct amount of
land proportional to its population is China. Russia
has double the territory of China, and something like
a third of the total population. And, thanks to
cheap railway fares, the Russian population spreads
quietly and naturally. After the war we must
nationalise a steamship service for the use of British
subjects only, and make it possible to travel anywhere
in the Empire for a pound or so, paying for food
according to a normal tariff. We must give emigrants
privileges in our own Colonies that they would not
obtain in the United States. We must set up big
Imperial works, and spend time and money in
development. We must not relax our rule of the
seas, but go on building an ever better, ever more
efficient Navy, and not underman it. We must live<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
even more on the sea than we have done in the past,
for the seas are our high roads, the connecting links
of Empire. We must get out of the foolish habit of
thinking of Canada and Australia and South Africa
as terribly far away. It is a little world, and there
is scarcely a far-away in it. We have to give to our
working men, and to their children in the schools, the
consciousness of belonging to a big and glorious thing
rather than the consciousness of belonging to a little
State that is almost played out. Let us think of
Russia with her bigness, her space, her consciousness
of unity, and of the large thing, and remember we
have all the possibilities of health and splendour that
the Russians have if we will only face our problems
and do the things which are obvious to all except
to those who fight in the political arena for fighting&#8217;s
sake.</p>

<p>To recapitulate:</p>

<p>(1) Russia has at least double the white population
in her Empire that we have in ours. Why
should we not take steps to transplant from over-crowded
Britain to the less crowded parts of the
Empire, and so get better families?</p>

<p>(2) The Russian Empire is all on land, and is
easily strung together by railways, whereas our
Empire is across seas. Fares within the Russian
Empire are cheap. Why should we not popularise
our ocean travel and have cheap fares on the seas?</p>

<p>(3) Russia, through certain natural advantages,
keeps her race pure, even on the outskirts of Empire.
Why should we let our own people go to the United<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
States, and try to fill up our Colonies with aliens
who, in time of war, are ready to blow up Parliament
buildings, powder factories, plot assassinations,
and what not?</p>

<p>(4) Russia is self-supporting in food, fuel, and
clothing. Why should not we be?</p>

<p>(5) The Duma is elected by the people not only
of Russia in Europe, but by the people of the whole
Russian Empire. Why should not we have Imperial
representatives in the House of Commons&mdash;one man
one vote for all white British citizens.</p>

<p>(6) The Russian Empire is a large unity with a
growing consciousness of its own power. Why should
not the British Empire realise similar possibilities of
unity and self-expression?</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
